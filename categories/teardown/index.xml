Another teardown post! This one was also a cheap &ldquo;because i&rsquo;m curious&rdquo; post.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="what">What</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s a &lsquo;decora&rsquo; style wall switch with WiFI and an RGB color changing paddle.</p>
<figure >

<p>The product listing was very non specific:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EU US WiFi Smart Wall Switch Push Button Timer Relay Switch Voice Remote Control RGB LED Night Light Lamp TUYA Alexa Google Home</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I saw <code>TuYa</code> in the item description and hoped that it would be based on an ESP8266 module or at least use a pin-compatible module. After all, there are a few such devices on the <a href="https://templates.blakadder.com/switch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Wall Switches and Dimmers section</a> of the tasmota templates repository.</p>
<h2 id="teardown">Teardown</h2>
<p>Almost immediately after opening it became clear: the item is a variant of the <a href="https://templates.blakadder.com/moko_SSMS118-01AI.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"><code>SSMS118-01AI</code></a> switch.</p>
<p>Other than that, the internals are pretty predictable / standard.</p>
<p>From the side you can see plastic clips holding the paddle to the Aluminum substrate.</p>

<p>Almost textbook design at this point; keep the mains voltage on it&rsquo;s own PCB and only send back low voltage / signal to the controller PCB.</p>
<p>The mains PCB attaches to the controller PCB via 3 sets of three male/female pin headers along the top and bottom of the left edge and one side of the right edge.</p>

<p>Mains PCB is marked <code>HYS-00-004-MAIN_V1.1</code> with a datecode of <code>2019-5-7</code>.</p>
<p>Equally sparse controller PCB. Aside from the <em>massive</em> mechanical switch and the three transistors for the RGB leds, everything lives on the ESP module.
At first glance, the module looks like a standard ESP-12&hellip; but it isn&rsquo;t! There are 6 pins on each of the three edges, not the 8 that would be present on an ESP-12 module.</p>

<p>Controller PCB is marked <code>HYS-00-004-WIFI_V1.1</code> with a datecode of <code>2019-4-11</code>.</p>
<p>After a bit of reverse image searching, the ESP based module appears to be a WT8266-S1s. The datasheet can be found <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/document/word/WT8266-S1%20DataSheet%20V1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thats all for this one!</p>

<p>Curiosity got the better of me while putting together a BOM for a project and I decided to add one of the new Shelly devices to my order to bump the total over the threshold for a nice discount.</p>
<p>I have not seen a ton of discussion about what&rsquo;s inside of a any of the new Shelly Pro devices.
These &lsquo;next generation&rsquo; devices appear to all use a <a href="https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/gen2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">common and more <em>uniform</em> API</a> which, apparently, is too demanding of the ESP8266 based hardware so it won&rsquo;t be backported.</p>
<p>A cursory google only reveals some light technical details from a <a href="https://www.shelly-support.eu/forum/index.php?thread/10795-shelly-pro-4pm-teardown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">teardown post on a german site</a>. All of the pictures attached ot that post require a login üôÅ.</p>
<p>So here is <em>my</em> teardown. No login required!</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="what">What</h1>
<p>The Shelly Pro 4 PM is a rather compact DIN mounted relay/power monitoring module with some connectivity. The <code>4</code> is for the number of channels that can be independently switches and monitored.</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>
        
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>As for connectivity, the <a href="https://shelly.cloud/knowledge-base/devices/shelly-pro-4pm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">official product page</a> sums it up nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professional 4 channels relay with Wi-Fi, LAN, and Bluetooth connection, suitable for home and facility automation with remote control and precise power management. DIN rail mountable inside a breaker box. Enhanced safety features and compatible with most used home automation platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="teardown">Teardown</h2>
<p>This Shelly 4PM feels like a step backwards in terms of build quality. The prior generation of devices were very dense little pucks and this feels pretty hollow; the plastic DIN case creaks and squeaks.</p>
<p>The internal layout isn&rsquo;t my favorite and it made both disassembly and reassembly a bit tenuous at a few points.
The layout may be inevitable, though, as DIN case is more or less a standard shape and size.
Layouts are almost always a bit weird when the electronics have to be designed to fit the case rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>Other than the layout quirks, the Shelly team continues to go with what they know: the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">espressif</a> line of chips. This time the ESP826x series is out and the much more capable ESP32 series is in&hellip; which allows for both the color LCD and the ethernet interface.</p>
<p>As is common with these types of devices, the ESP runs the show&hellip; but it has a few deputies: dedicated power monitoring ICs and an ethernet PHY.</p>
<p>And with that, let&rsquo;s get into it:</p>
<p>The main body of the shelly is clipped to the rear &lsquo;plate&rsquo; which houses the DIN rail attachment mechanism. You can see the clips on the very top and bottom along the left edge:</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>
        
        <p>
        40A at 240V is a _lot_ of power to fit into a fairly compact device!
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Viewed from the rear, the clips are easier to see in the four corners:</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>
        
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The rear plate lifts off to reveal the largest PCB. There are 4 copies of the same circuit. Very nice to see big traces with extra solder and some beefy current shunts!</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>
        
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Just behind the &lsquo;input trigger&rsquo; terminals on the main PCB is a <code>2x10 @ 2.54mm pitch</code> female header. Into which slides the &lsquo;smarts&rsquo; PCB which hosts the main ESP32 MCU as well as the ethernet jack.</p>
<p>On this smaller PCB and next to the ethernet jack is a very small <code>1x6 @ 1mm pitch</code> female header block. It is cleverly hidden next to the jack but could probably be accessed with the case on if you&rsquo;re careful.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, this is a debug/programming header for at least the main MCU.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not pictured until later, but there is a <code>2x2 @ 2.54mm pitch</code> male header block on the other side of the smarts PCB. This is where a small daughterboard containing only the 3 buttons connects.</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>
        
        <p>
        How much do you want to bet that the pins on the debug header are the usual &#43;3.3, GND, IO0, RX, TX for ESP flashing?
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>On the main PCB, behind the &lsquo;smarts&rsquo; PCB is a set of two ICs marked with <code>ADE7953ACPZ</code>. As expected, these are <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/analog-devices-inc/ADE7953ACPZ/2700176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">the energy management / monitoring ICs</a>.</p>
<p>Why two crystals, though?</p>
<p>The IC marked <code>MCP23S17</code> is a simple SPI based IO expander&hellip; almost certainly used to drive the relays and possibly command the power management ICs.</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>
        
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>On the rear of the &lsquo;smarts&rsquo; PCB is the star of the show: <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Espressif-Systems/ESP32-D0WDQ6?qs=chTDxNqvsykWgzfXx0gR%252BQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">ESP32-D0WDQ6</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the passives and the flat flex socket for the LCD, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>cFeon QH64-104HIP 64 Megabit flash chip</li>
<li>SMSC8720A: 10/100 Megabit ethernet PHY</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also <em>another</em> daughterboard covered in kapton tape. This is soldered to the main PCB and just has a few electrolytic caps. I guess this arrangement was easier than trying to clear some room on the back of the main PCB so the heavy current traces could be kept simple ü§î?</p>
<p>In the top right corner you can see the 4 pin header where the button daughter board attaches&hellip; just next to the ethernet phy.</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>

<p>From this angle, still in the top right corner, you can see the button daughter board attached to the 4 pin header.</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>
        
        <p>
        Just a few very tiny passives!
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Electrically, nothing unusual or bizarre. Layout was a bit &lsquo;inventive&rsquo; but the unusual but standard shape of the case probably drove at least some of the decision to have 4 different PCBs that all have to be tediously connected by hand during manufacture!</p>
<p>Thats all for this one!</p>

<hr>
<h1 id="why">Why</h1>
<p>I was looking for a way to actuate some heavy blackout curtains.</p>
<p>There have been <em>several</em> DIY projects out there that manipulate curtains but they all appear to be relatively involved as they are often designed for a very specific type of curtain; servos that fit on the &lsquo;tilt rod&rsquo; or motors that can manipulate the pull chain&hellip; etc.</p>
<p>The specific curtains that I wanted to power-actuate  are curtains that do not have a pull string or a set of wheels/track to facilitate their movement. Just folds of fabric hanging directly from a telescopic metal rod.</p>
<p>After a quick review of hte existing commercial solutions for my application/style of curtains, it became clear that they all work in about the same way: some battery powered motor mechanically couples to the curtain rod and moves along the rod dragging / pushing the curtain as it does so.</p>
<p>Since they all more or less use the same design, I figured that most of the differentiation between products would be in the software side of things. No product immediately stood out as having <strong>local</strong> Home Assistant integration so it didn&rsquo;t matter which product I selected; I will inevitably have to do some reverse engineering / hacking to get <strong>local</strong> Home Assistant integration.</p>
<p>I selected the <code>Tuya Smart Curtain Driver Robot</code> because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cheap</li>
<li>Appeared to use USB-C for charging</li>
<li>I was vaguely aware that <a href="https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">TuYa was pumping out a <em>ton</em> of ESP8266 based hardware</a> and hoped that I&rsquo;d find the familiar microcontroller inside.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is a collection of photos and some thoughts that are - roughly - what I wish I had been able to find when doing the product research.
If I had found the equivalent of this post while doing my research, I would have been able to save myself a purchase!</p>
<h1 id="what">What</h1>
<p>Searching for rod-based curtain actuators will turn up a <em>ton</em> of results. A fair number of them use product images very similar to these:</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>

        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>How well the robot performs will depend on how well the little white wheel is held against the bottom of the curtain rod.
The arms that the upper sled attaches to are spring loaded for additional clamping force.</p>
<p>The case seems to be fairly generic and used across multiple brands so it&rsquo;s safe to say that depending on the version / hardware variant, you may or may not have all of the featured inputs/sensors.</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>
        
        <p>
        Only one of the two units in a pair comes equipped with the light sensor.
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The light sensor is a nice touch. I will absolutely be borrowing that idea when designing my own solution üí°ü§î!</p>
<h2 id="teardown">Teardown</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of unboxing videos. The box is rather unremarkable; it sustained some damage in transit, but that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s supposed to do.</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>
        
        <p>
        Relatively well packaged. The seller that I purchased from had explicit listings for different curtain rod styles so I am not sure why I received hardware for all styles. There does not appear to be any easy way to install this hardware.
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The upper sled is coupled to the main body through two spring-loaded arms with a ratchet and paw setup. The arms can be easily removed from the main body if needed.</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>
        
        <p>
        I am getting some vague Portal2 Turret vibes...
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Since the entire weight of the robot will be hanging from the upper sled, the springs are the only thing that will pull the actuator wheel into the curtain rod. I don&rsquo;t know how the springs will last over time, but I absolutely can forsee needing to re-tension things as the springs inevitably stretch out.</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>
        
        <p>
        The ratchet/paws seem to indicate compatibility with some comically large diameter curtain rods!

<p>Use a Philips style <code>J00</code> or <code>J000</code> screwdriver to remove the four screws holding the thing together. Use any flat pry tool to crack the two halves apart.</p>

        Screw hiding under warranty void sticker and obvious mechanical/snap seam make it pretty obvious how this will come apart.

    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>And with that, our first real look at the electronics inside!</p>
<p>I expected a simple PCB that contained a charge controller circuit for the battery and a simple motor driver with over current protection&hellip; and nothing else. I was sure that <em>everything</em> else would be handled directly by a the radio-on-module.</p>
<p>I <em>absolutely</em> did not expect the PCB to have provisions for &hellip; <strong>two</strong> radio modules!</p>
<p>A few other quick observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The unpopulated radio module footprint does not match any ESP-8266 modules that I am familiar with.</li>
<li>The populated radio module <em>does</em> look like a common ESP-12E module footprint&hellip; but the module is <em>clearly</em> not an ESP.</li>
<li>The markings have been erased from all the interesting ICs ü§¨.</li>
<li>The 20 pin chip closest to the unpopulated module footprint could be anything but is likely the &lsquo;housekeeping&rsquo; CPU. The populated radio module likely communicates with this chip to command the motor and check the sensors</li>
<li>The product marketing photos indicated that there would be a light sensor. The PCB appears to have a foot print for an LDR&hellip; but it&rsquo;s not populated&hellip;
only a few passive components besides some radio-on-module</li>
<li>The USB-C port does not have any active electronics connected to it. The port likely does not speak any power delivery protocols and certainly does not have a hidden UART for talking to either of the microcontrollers.</li>
<li>No motor is visible so that means that it must be embedded in the comically small drive wheel&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>Some more technical details are discussed <a href="#technical-details" rel="">below</a>.</p>

        Huh. Was not expecting the PCB to be quite so big or complex!

<p>Lifting up the PCB reveals the battery pack. I did not slice the pack open to see which brand of cells went into the pack.

<p>I was still looking for that elusive light sensor so I opened up the second unit&hellip; and found it!</p>
<p>Other than the populated second radio module, <code>R20</code> and the LDR, the PCBs appear identical.</p>

        Something tells me that the PCB with two radio modules is the &#39;leader&#39; out of the two.

<p>On the rear we can see an obvious programming / debug port and a PCB/product designator: <code>ZNCL_TY_V1.5</code>.</p>
<p>Giving that a quick google returns almost nothing.
I did find <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/esp32/comments/q3omwh/can_somebody_tell_me_what_were_looking_at_here/hft52t1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> post from <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/coned_miro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">/u/coned_miro</a> asking about a very similar PCB revision:</p>
<pre><code>    ...The main board says 'ZNCL_TY_V1.3' on the back
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing new to be learned about the tuya device from that thread, sadly.</p>

        No, I didn&#39;t hook a scope up or trace out the obvious programming/debug header.

<h2 id="the-app">The App</h2>
<p>I never intended to use the manufacturer provided app for anything other than the initial setup so this will be a very brief section. The robot was quickly discovered and provisioned through the app.</p>

<p>The device calibration process is pretty rudimentary and does not have an easy &ldquo;undo&rdquo; process.</p>
<p>If you make a mistake in configuring the direction/distance that the robot needs to travel for curtain open/close, you have to factory reset the device. Fortunately this is easy to do in app and discovering/re-provisioning the device takes only a few seconds.</p>
<p>The <em>two</em> firmware version strings strongly hints at a &ldquo;two processors for two domains&rdquo; architecture: the anonymous 20pin chip runs everything on the PCB and the <code>BT7L</code> module deals with external communications and is only abstractly aware of the PCB/motor/sensor/battery state.</p>

        I have only skimmed the TuYa developer documentation but I think that the VirtualID is common to _all_ of the curtain robots.

<h1 id="verdict">Verdict</h1>
<p>While disappointing that there was no easily hackable ESP microcontroller running the show, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.
I can&rsquo;t use this product as is for my intended application; the motor is just too puny for the task.</p>

<p>My curtains are rather thick and heavy. A tiny motor can&rsquo;t <em>possibly</em> have enough power to do this on it&rsquo;s own&hellip; especially with a sub-optimal coupling mechanism!</p>
<p>To give the motor a fighting chance, the engineers went with a TON of reduction-gearing.
The gearbox allows a wimpy but fast motor to become a more grunty motor at the expense of speed.
Almost anything small that rotates at high speed will come with some unpleasant sounds. This is ESPECIALLY true for cheaply made gearbox full of small gears.</p>
<p>This means that any invocation of the robot will be noisy.
You can expect the noisy little device to <em>slowly</em> move across the curtain rod. üôÑ</p>
<p>The robot struggled to push the curtains together towards the end of an opening cycle&hellip; it would often skip in place as the drive wheel struggled to keep enough traction on the curtin rod.</p>
<p>Likewise, asking the robot to pull the bucked up curtains closed was out of the question without some sort of an assist.</p>
<p>Because the robot has no fixed position sensor, it can&rsquo;t really measure where on the curtain rod it is.
Every time the drive wheel skips, the difference between where the robot thinks it is and where it <em>actually</em> is will grow.</p>
<p>If you can stand the whiny/slow movement, expect frequent re-calibrations üëé.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Looks like there&rsquo;s a reason why the hobbyist/DIY community has produced such a <em>wide variety</em> of bespoke curtain/drape actuators&hellip; most of the commercial ones have sacrificed too much in order to be widely usable.
The solution that I end up implementing will be designed with my heavy drapes in mind and will use an appropriately sized and quiet motor!</p>

<h1 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h1>
<p>A highly condensed version of my initial notes from setup/teardown:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Was not expecting multiple radio units. The blue radio-module that both PCBs have in common appears to be a <code>JDY-25M</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a SDK for the <code>JDY-25M</code> available <a href="https://github.com/Edragon/JDY-MESH/tree/main/JDY-25M/SDK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>. It contains some english documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>JDY-25M</code> SDK does not appear to contain any information about how to program the chip or build a custom firmware. You are meant to interface with the &lsquo;stock&rsquo; firmware via <code>AT+</code> commands. The firmware appears to support multiple modes&hellip; including a bi-directional communication link. I suspect that the unique radio module is the connection to the outside world and the the two identical radio modules are used to coordinate movement between the two pods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was never able to get the &lsquo;follower&rsquo; unit to pair or otherwise command the second unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unique radio module is a module made specifically by/for TuYa: <a href="https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/bt7l?id=K96gqp1dp6iiw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/bt7l?id=K96gqp1dp6iiw</a></p>

</ul>
<h2 id="pcb-markings">PCB Markings</h2>
