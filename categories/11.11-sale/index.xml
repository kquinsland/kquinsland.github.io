<p>I guess this is becoming a <a href="http://localhost:1313/categories/11.11-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">tradition</a> now?</p>
<p>During China&rsquo;s Single&rsquo;s Day sale on AliExpress, I bought various gadgets - both for projects and out of curiosity.
Rather than write separate posts, here&rsquo;s a collection of mini teardowns showing what&rsquo;s inside each item.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for a better scene controller/switch/Home Assistant interface.
I was curious about which chip they used for the full graphics display and was hoping for an easily hackable Android device.
Unfortunately, no such luck with this.</p>
<p>The main application processor is <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/F1C100s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"><code>F1C100s</code></a> which is a low-cost, low-power, ARM9-based SoC.
It might be able to run a custom Linux build that could draw a custom UI, but it&rsquo;s not going to be as easy as rooting an Android device.</p>
<p>There’s not much in the box, just the switch and a manual.

<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty standard &ldquo;power supply and relays in the back, touch screen in the front&rdquo; design.
This time, though, there&rsquo;s an <em>exposed</em> programming header!?</p>

<p>The power supply doesn&rsquo;t look too bad.
Clearance looks OK, there is a fuse, and the soldering is decent.
I don&rsquo;t know how well isolated that transformer is, but it&rsquo;s probably fine.</p>

<p>As the USB-C PD standard matures and GaN technology makes high-power chargers cheaper, it&rsquo;s fun to see the internals get more complex but also more integrated.
This was less than $15 shipped which is <em>insane</em> for a 100W+ charger unless they cut corners somewhere&hellip;</p>

<p>Other than that, it&rsquo;s about what you&rsquo;d expect from a modern USB-C charger that isn&rsquo;t hyper-compact; beefy looking AC-to-DC converter, a few big caps and then the USB-C PD controller.</p>
<p>Between each group of ports is a series of passives, some beefy looking power MOSFETs and a protocol negotiation IC.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, they used a micro USB port for charging.
This is <em>inexcusable</em> in 2024.
The silk screen on the PCB indicates that the design is from late 2020, which would be slightly more acceptable if USB-C wasn’t already the standard by then.
Furthermore, this device doesn’t need any complicated USB-C PD features, so it’s not like they’d have to worry about the extra cost or complexity of a USB-C controller.
Really, all they needed was <em>two</em> (very important, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/07/16/exploring-the-raspberry-pi-4-usb-c-issue-in-depth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"><strong>NOT</strong> ONE</a>) 5.1k resistors and a USB-C port and they could have been future proofed!</p>

<p>They scrubbed the markings off the SOIC16 CPU. The rest of the components are about what you’d expect for managing lithium batteries, switching the fan, and driving the boost converter for the ozone generator.</p>
<p>It appears another version of this device also features a buzzer.
I&rsquo;m not sure what for, but the silk screen clearly shows a spot for it.</p>

<p>This is the first of a few LED controllers I bought to see if they are compatible with <a href="https://kno.wled.ge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">WLED</a> or ESPHome.
I have some <a href="#side-note-the-ossha-community-is-being-heard" rel="">thoughts</a> on the state of the LED controller market, but to summarize: it&rsquo;s <em>getting better</em>!</p>
<p>The packaging is very nondescript, containing just the controller and a manual.</p>

It also includes a small condenser microphone for the music reactive mode.</p>

<p>Yep, the ESP32 is on a separate PCB that&rsquo;s connected to the main board via a header.
The silk screen on the PCB makes me think that this was <em>initially</em> developed for an ESP8266 but then they added the header for the ESP32 module late(?) in design.</p>

<p>Because this is an &ldquo;addressable&rdquo; LED controller, there&rsquo;s not much to look at.
The GPIO from the ESP goes more or less directly to the output pins.</p>

<p>I saved the <em>best</em> for last!
This LED controller <em>really</em> did surprise me with how open it is!</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not putting a generic &ldquo;ESP32 powered&rdquo; message on the label leaving the reader to read between the lines / infer that the device can be flashed with alternate firmware.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re straight up saying so!
The label has the GPIO pins clearly labeled.
It uses USB-C for power and flashing.
The USB port is <em>modern</em> unlike <a href="#generic-ozone-generator-xd001" rel="">other</a> devices I&rsquo;ve <a href="#gledepto-gl-c-015wl-d-led-controller" rel="">shown</a> in this post.
The USB port can also be used for programming and isn&rsquo;t hidden!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to hoping that they release a version for analog LED strips! 🤞</p>

<h3 id="side-note-the-ossha-community-is-being-heard">side note: the OSS/HA community is being heard</h3>
<p>Over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve been scouring AliExpress to find the latest and greatest in LED controllers and every year I&rsquo;ve been disappointed.
But over the last year or so, I&rsquo;ve noticed a <em>huge</em> uptick in the number of controllers that are <em>actually</em> compatible with Home Assistant and other open-source home automation systems.</p>
<p>In the beginning, they were all ESP8266 based and trivial to reverse engineer and flash.
Then they started using TuYa intermediate MCUs which were a bit more tedious to reverse engineer but still possible if you were willing to put in the effort.</p>
<p>Now, they&rsquo;re using ESP32 based chips and going out of their way to LABEL which GPIOs go to which pin(s) and to generally make it TRIVIAL to flash WLED or ESPHome or whatever you want.</p>
<p>This means some savvy manufacturers are paying attention and recognizing the growing hobbyist market for these devices and are catering to them.
There&rsquo;s somebody out there that&rsquo;s not going to force their garbage app/api on you and is going to let you do whatever you want with the device you bought.
This was UNHEARD OF just a few years ago and I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> happy to see it happening now!</p>

<p>And the winner of the &ldquo;feels most like a hand-built prototype&rdquo; award goes to&hellip; this thing!</p>
<p>Normally I don&rsquo;t like it when screws are hidden under labels / stickers&hellip; but in this case, the &ldquo;sticker&rdquo; is a rubber foot that doesn&rsquo;t even &ldquo;hide&rdquo; the screws.</p>

<p>Looking from the side, the construction becomes pretty clear; it&rsquo;s probably just using a PCB for the heating element and the stacked PCBs separated with little brass standoffs is for thermal isolation.</p>

<p>USB-C for power is <em>always</em> a good sign.
Other than that, a basic <a href="https://www.mcu.com.cn/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">CMSemicon</a> IC runs the show.</p>
<p>The OLED screen module is for sure one of those prototype modules meant for hobbyists!</p>

<p>USB-C &ldquo;expansion&rdquo; docs are a dime a dozen now.
This caught my attention because of the LCD display on the side.
What are the odds that it presents as a second display using <a href="https://www.displayport.org/displayport-over-usb-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">display port tunneling</a> via usb-alt mode?</p>
<p>There are no screws, just clips.</p>

<p>It looks like a pretty straightforward de-mux and breakout PCB.
The display is an isolated / standalone component that&rsquo;s linked to the main PCB with just 4 wires.
What are the odds that it&rsquo;s hanging off a USB hub?</p>

<p>The silk screen markings make me think that the &ldquo;internal&rdquo; name for this product is <code>K0108-1D</code>.
Interesting that the <code>HUB</code> PCB has a date code almost a full <em>year</em> after the <code>LCD</code> PCB..
Also worth noting; the instructions that came with the device link to the same shady <code>key123.vip</code> site that the <a href="#ajazz-akp03e-stream-deck-clone" rel="">ajazz</a> used so there&rsquo;s <em>definitely</em> some sort of relationship between the two but I&rsquo;m not sure what it is.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, they lasered off the markings on the display module.
I don&rsquo;t have a clip for the eeprom, but I bet that there&rsquo;d be at least a few interesting strings in there :D.</p>

<p>After seeing that the LCD is just a standalone module, I wanted to see how it presented itself to the host.
As expected, it&rsquo;s just a USB hub with a few devices hanging off it.
The display module is almost certainly the HID device.</p>

<p>This is a clone/knockoff of the Elgato Stream Deck products.
I was curious to see if they did anything differently than the original for the internal hardware.
Turns out, no.

<p>The software is <em>super</em> sketchy; just trying to find a build that actually worked on macOS was a pain!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.a-jazz.com/en/search.jsp?id=422&amp;q=03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">official site</a> looks and functions like it was made with a 2000s-era website builder 🤮.</p>
<p>With some google-fu, I found links to a <a href="https://bbs.key123.vip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">web forum</a> that may not be officially related to the product, but <a href="https://bbs.key123.vip/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=1167&amp;highlight=AKP03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">has some download links</a> to software that is supposed to work with the device, on macOS in English.</p>
<p>I never got a working build of the software, but the few builds that I did try all have the same architecture; a <code>Qt</code> app that hosts plugins and does all of the thinking for the device.</p>
<p>With a bit more digging, I think that this &ldquo;Mirabox&rdquo; company is the underlying OEM and the ajazz is just a white-labeled version of this product: <a href="https://miraboxbuy.com/collections/stream-dock/products/streamdock-mbox-n3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Stream Dock MBox 293N3</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for a &ldquo;Works with Home Assistant&rdquo; version of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Wall-Clock---An-Echo-companion-to-see-timers-at-a-glance./dp/B07FQDMKFT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Echo Wall Clock</a> ever since Amazon discontinued it.</p>
<p>I was hoping this would be a simple ESP8266 or ESP32 module linked directly to the LEDs&hellip; but there&rsquo;s an anonymous intermediate microcontroller in there.</p>
<p>Assuming that the microcontroller can be removed easily and the various segments of addressable LEDs can be driven directly from an ESP8266 or ESP32, this could still be a viable base for a custom LED wall clock.</p>

<p>This was actually a late addition to the list.

<p>As was the case with the other LCD modules, this looks like it&rsquo;s just USB 2.0 module hanging off a USB hub.
Conceivably, you could embed a tiny raspberry pi zero or other <em>small</em> computer with USB Host support inside this thing 🤔&hellip;</p>

<p>The two internal PCBs are marked very similarly to the <a href="#generic-usb-c-dock-w-lcd" rel="">USB-Dock</a> <em>and</em> the <a href="#ajazz-akp03e-stream-deck-clone" rel="">Stream Deck clone</a> which really does make me think that mirabox is the ODM for those products as well.</p>
<p>Markings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HSV293-N4-LCD</p>
<p>20240807</p>
<p>HSV293-N4-SW</p>
<p>202400711</p></blockquote>
<p>And the USB hub PCB in the base doesn&rsquo;t have a part number, just a date code.
I&rsquo;d bet that they started designing this product in spring of 2024 and they finished the simplest part - the USB hub - first.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singles%27_Day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Single&rsquo;s Day</a> is a big deal in China and AliExpress has a big sale in celebration.</p>
<p>In addition to project supplies, I found quite a few items that can only be classified as  &ldquo;ohh, that looks interesting and I need another $11 in the cart to unlock free shipping&hellip;&rdquo; items.</p>
<p>I was planing on doing a series of posts covering some of the stuff I bought but nothing on it&rsquo;s own was really &ldquo;worth&rdquo; a full post so instead of a bunch of short <a href="/tags/two-minute-teardown/" rel="">&ldquo;Two Minute Teardown&rdquo;</a> posts, I decided to just roll everything into this massive post.</p>
<p>And with that, here&rsquo;s a whole grab bag of worth of #TwoMinuteTeardowns with the appropriate level of detail for each item.</p>

<p>This was a mistake on my part.
I saw a BTLE powered device tracker shaped and styled exactly like an air tag for <strong>$5 shipped</strong> and thought &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;
One good reason why not: it&rsquo;s not compatible with Apple&rsquo;s Find My network.</p>
<p>In hindsight, if it was only $5 and if it worked &rsquo;natively&rsquo; with apple devices&hellip; I&rsquo;d have heard about it before browsing Ali Express!</p>

<p>A bit more going on than you&rsquo;d expect at first; I was expecting a simple Switch Mode power supply driver for DC and then a single MCU to do everything but the WiFi.
Not so!
There&rsquo;s a dedicated chip for power monitoring, BT, Power supply, and the main MCU&hellip;</p>

<p>Unfortunately you have to peel off the screen cover to get access to the screws.
At least they&rsquo;re just regular philips screws and not some weird security screws.</p>
<p>Interesting to see the IR sensor at the top. Presumably this is for proximity sensing to turn the screen on and off and not some kind of IR blaster or remote control.</p>

<p>Looks like it&rsquo;s using a micro controller to do the heavy lifting and only communicate to the TuYa module via UART.
This is a common and well-supported pattern for these kinds of devices &hellip; even if it does mean that it won&rsquo;t be <em>trivial</em> to just replace the TuYa module with an ESPHome or Tasmota compatible module.</p>
<p>Sniffing the UART shouldn&rsquo;t be that difficult but it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m going to do in this post.</p>

<p>The various sensors aren&rsquo;t easily removed or clearly identified so your guess is as good as mine.
The main PCB has a few unpopulated connections so this module either works with a different suite of sensors or - more likely - supports a few different footprints for each sensor.</p>

<p>I am 100% sure that this power supply was originally designed for something else.
One of the original leads was cut off before the power supply was re-purposed.</p>

<p>Too much glue keeping everything the power supply together for me to bother taking it apart further.

The markings match the same chip that showed up in the <a href="#tuya-wifi-power-monitor" rel="">power monitor</a> above.
The power monitor has both WiFi and Bluetooth so it&rsquo;s not a stretch to think that this chip is Bluetooth connectivity.</p>

<p>This is nothing more than a desk-friendly version of the <a href="/electronics-lab-enhanced-bench-psu/" rel="">RD6006</a> power supply and it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything that came in the box:</p>

<p>It shipped with this power supply and a barrel jack to USB-C adapter&hellip; because the DP100 actually expects its power to come <em>from</em> a USB-C/PD capable source.
It&rsquo;ll be trivial to use this power supply with a USB-C power bank.
It - annoyingly - has a USB-A <strong><em>male</em></strong> port for data logging / firmware updates.
At least they included a Male &lt;-&gt; Male USB A cable&hellip;
I would have preferred two USB-C ports with clear labeling about which was meant for PD input and which was meant for PC communications.</p>

<h3 id="markings-and-other-details-6">Markings and other details</h3>
<p>Unfortunately most of the ICs didn&rsquo;t photograph well or otherwise have scratched / obscured markings.
Most of the power switching ICs <em>look</em> like they&rsquo;re from Monolithic Power Systems but I can&rsquo;t confirm exactly.</p>
