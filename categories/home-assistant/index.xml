&lt;p&gt;I have been experimenting with the concept of a Home Assistant powered &lt;a href="https://www.qsrautomations.com/blog/kitchen-automation/what-is-a-kds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;KDS&lt;/a&gt; for a few years now and have found that the refrigerator happens to be an especially good place to surface some information and device controls.&lt;/p&gt;

 Yes, it&amp;#39;s over-exposed and shot at an awkward angle but that&amp;#39;s what it took to minimize glare!

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe, but the venerable Home Assistant project has just celebrated it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2020/09/17/release-115/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7th&lt;/strong&gt; birthday with release &lt;code&gt;.115&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! While HA does get better with each new release, it is by no means perfect :D. This post came about because of a new feature in release &lt;code&gt;.115&lt;/code&gt; and the subsequent limitations of that feature!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of trying to integrate Home Assistant with all the things, everybody eventually hits some major limitation or bug and is forced to find some sort of workaround. Below are a few techniques that I&amp;rsquo;ve collected over the years to simplify some of my Home Assistant configuration and work around some of the platforms various limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
