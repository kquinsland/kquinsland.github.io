# Systemd Resolved With Consul Agent


I pieced this technique together a while back and created a gist for it. I'm creating _this_ post as a pointer to that gist so I have something that's a bit easier to reference and refer others to.

And i want to test out the [hugo shortcode for embedding a gist](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#gist) :smirk:.


The really short version:

- Create a dedicated interface that can only be accessed from the local system
- Bind the consul-agent's DNS service to this local only interface
- Tell [`systemd-resolved`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-resolved.service.html) that all hostnames with the `.consul` TLD can be resolved via a DNS server on this local interface


No need to disable `resolved` and replace it with dnsmasq :smile:
