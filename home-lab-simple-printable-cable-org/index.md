Quick / another "i made a thing!" post.

{{< figure name="installed" >}}

I needed some horizontal / vertical cable rings for cat5 and power cables. I would have used the excellent [1U Rackmount Cable Management Rings](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3315960) by [boulwarek](https://www.thingiverse.com/boulwarek/about) except the hole spacing didn't work for my application. I needed cable rings for the 'front-to-back' braces which have distinct dimensions:

- holes needed to be spaced `10.85mm` apart
- distance between center of screw is `20.0mm`

I made the rings slightly smaller as the horizontal / vertical runs I needed rings for do not carry more than a few cables.
