# ESPHome on dingtian-tech relay modules

<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD002 -->

This is another one of those quick "I wish that was easier to find when I was googling it" posts.

For a project, I needed a small relay module to switch a few mains loads.
I chose this generic looking relay module from AliExpress because it was powered by an ESP32 and featured ethernet connectivity.

{{<figure name="cover-product_image">}}

AliExpress is full of generic looking relay modules but [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800812755068.html) one is branded [`dingtian-tech`](https://www.dingtian-tech.com/en_us/relay2.html)

The device came with an obvious programming header right next to the ESP32 so I thought it would be a 5 minute job to flash Tasmota and [probe the GPIOs](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Configuration-Procedure-for-New-Devices/).

**N.O.P.E.**

This post is a super condensed version of my notes that I'm posting in the off chance that they're useful for somebody else.

## ESP32 Secure Boot

{{< admonition success "Update: 2023.12" >}}

I needed a few more of these modules for another project and before placing my order, I asked about the possibility of getting an "empty" module shipped with no firmware protections set.

The seller told me to place my order and then message them with the order number and a note asking to `send relay board with test firmware`.

I did just that and a little over two weeks later, I received a module with no protections set!
{{< /admonition >}}

No matter what I did to flash the ESP32 module, it would always boot loop with output like this:

```text
rst:0x1 (POWERON_RESET),boot:0x7 (DOWNLOAD_BOOT(UART0/UART1/SDIO_REI_REO_V2))‚êç‚êä
waiting for download‚êç‚êä
<break>
<0xff>ets Jun  8 2016 00:22:57‚êç‚êä
```

I knew that I didn't brick anything because the ESP would boot right up as soon as i re-flashed the original dump.

Turns out, there's [a few reasons](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/113) why this might happen but in this case, it's because [secure boot was enabled](https://www.esp32.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=19176&start=10).

Because at least a decent chunk of the flash dump I took was in plain text, I didn't thing that there was any flash protection in place but sure enough, at least some of the protection features have been enabled:

That's the first time I've _ever_ seen the security settings enabled on cheap IoT gear from China. ü§Ø

In hindsight, it should have been pretty obvious as the flash dump does not look like a "traditional" ESP flash dump:

```shell
‚ùØ binwalk flash_4M.bin

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1131864       0x114558        AES S-Box

```

It was late and I was tired so I didn't bother with trying to reverse engineer the flash dump or trying to figure out if there was a way to disable the protections.
Nothing was going to compete with 10 minute to heat-soak and remove the ESP module so I just did that.

And a better look at some of the PCB traces to the ethernet PHY:

{{<figure name="pcb_eth_phy">}}

With a "fresh" ESP module installed, figuring out th GPIO assignments wasn't particularly difficult.

| Function | Pin      | Note                                                                      |

| Input 3  | `GPIO34` | This is the `FACTORY` button. Same as `Input 1`.                          |
| LED 1    | `GPIO32` | This is the second little red LED next to the `FACTORY` button. Inverted. |
