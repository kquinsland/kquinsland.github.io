<p>While diagnosing a flakey fiber link, i ran into a situation where a basic &ldquo;flashing red&rdquo; visual fault finder was not sufficient.
I needed to actually measure the optical power levels on both ends of the link to ensure that the fiber was not damaged and that the SFPs were operating within spec.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6TY7X6K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">This</a> was the cheapest tool that could be delivered quickly.
The issue was found and fixed so now let&rsquo;s have a look inside.</p>

<p>The nice thing about simple devices like this is that they are easy to open and rather predictable inside.
From the back, there are four self-tapping screws holding the back panel on.
Removing those reveals a very simple interior.</p>
<p>The few unpopulated components near where the battery attaches are almost certainly for a &ldquo;better&rdquo; model that has a built in battery that can be recharged over the non populated USB-C port.</p>
<p>The square IC in the middle is running the show, the large IC off to the side is likely the display driver and the two SOP-16 chips near the ethernet port and optical sensors are for abstracting the details away for the benefit of the microcontroller.</p>

<p>There are 4 more screws holding the PCB to the front half of the case; if you remove them, you can get a look at the side of the PCB with the screen on it&hellip; revealing that there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing special on the other side of the PCB.</p>

<p>Recently, one of the USB ports on <a href="/hdmi-kvm-teardown-and-esphome/" rel="">my previous KVM switch</a> failed. Since it&rsquo;s a critical piece of equipment, I needed a replacement the same day. The original AliExpress product page was no longer available; the seller seems to have closed up shop entirely.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the OEM—<code>XUFUNG</code>—has released an updated version, now sold in the US as the <a href="https://www.tesmart.com/products/hks801-p23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">TESmart HKS801-P23-USBK</a>. It looks visually identical to the previous KVM switch, but the USB ports now feature the characteristic blue color indicating USB 3.0 support.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see that the power rails differ: 5V for the 4K version, and apparently there&rsquo;s an 8K version that uses 12V. It&rsquo;s also nice that the RX/TX lines are explicitly labeled; it makes things a bit easier to hack on.</p>

<h2 id="chips">Chips</h2>
<p>In no particular order, here are the main ICs I identified on the PCB:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://lcsc.com/product-detail/USB-Converters_Realtek-Semicon-RTS5411S-GR_C5356838.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">RTS5411s</a> - USB 3.1 Super-Speed HUB Controller
cx32l003f8</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>F68B / A1V8 - Not sure, can&rsquo;t find any positive ID. There&rsquo;s one for every RTS5411S port, though, and some traces do daisy chain between the individual F68B chips so i&rsquo;m guessing they&rsquo;re related to USB and possibly a buffer/signal conditioner?</p>
<ul>
<li>Interestingly enough, I don&rsquo;t see any traces from this chip to the &ldquo;slow&rdquo; USB ports that are meant to handle the keyboard/mouse. Those are monitored by the CH545L which is probably looking for the keyboard/mouse signals to trigger switching between banks.</li>

<ul>
<li>This is the micro on the LAN port; makes sense as it has a built in 10M Ethernet PHY</li>
<li>Assuming there&rsquo;s no restriction that prevents the ethernet PHY and BT PHY from being used at the same time, this KVM could have ditched the IR remote and used a phone app instead&hellip;</li>
<li>Previously, this was handled with a <a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm8s003f3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">ST 8S003f3p6</a> and a <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/WCH_Jiangsu_Qin_Heng-CH395Q/C87390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">WCH CH395Q</a> so the LAN controller has definitely had a BOM consolidation!</li>

<p>I am doing research for an upcoming project and was curious about how other people have solved a similar problem.
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RWF653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">This</a> happens to be the cheapest option that was available at the time.</p>
<p>I am primarily interested in the pump; the integrated &ldquo;low water&rdquo; sensor and the UV-C sterilization are very nice features that would check off a lot of boxes for me&hellip; Unfortunately this pump it lacks both the flow rate and the head that I need for my project.</p>

<p>The base isn&rsquo;t that spectacular; a cheap micro with BTLE controlling power to a basic wireless power transmission module.
The wireless power module is covered in conformal coating so the IC number was a pain to read but it is a XKT-511.
I can find <a href="https://leap.tardate.com/electronics101/power/wirelessledmodule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "><em>very</em> little information</a> about this IC.
As far as I can tell, it is similar to Qi wireless power but without any signaling or modulation of the carrier signal.
Various qi receiver devices will briefly &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; when placed on the base but they do not stay powered on or charge.
My <a href="/wozniak-wpx-0001a-qi-tester-teardown/" rel="">qi tester</a> does power up and measures about .2W but it can&rsquo;t recognize the protocol.</p>

<p>I ordered this part years ago for a project I eventually canceled.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t use it for anything, and it&rsquo;s just taking up space, so I&rsquo;m going to open it up before I recycle it.</p>
<p>The Ali Express listing is a 404 so I don&rsquo;t have a link to share or really any information about it.</p>
<p>The main thing to take away is that it&rsquo;s meant to interface with a liquid level sensor.
It will display the level of liquid in a tank and - optionally - trigger a few relays based on the level.</p>

<p>The main body slides off pretty easily.
There are two PCBs inside: one for the display and one to handle the relays and sensor input.</p>

<p>The display PCB is pretty simple; no active electronics and a tonne of LEDs.
The bar graph LEDs are almost certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">charlieplexed</a> but the 7 segment might have an integrated driver.</p>
<figure >

    
        
        

    

    <figcaption>

<p>The screw terminals on the rear of the case are directly soldered to the main PCB so I&rsquo;m not going to be able to take it apart any further without disordering things&hellip; defeating the spirit of the <a href="/tags/two-minute-teardown/" rel="">#TwoMinuteTeardown</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the top left, you can see the few pins for the 7-segment displays; a total of 12 pins.
Of those 12, some don&rsquo;t have traces leading to them so they&rsquo;re probably just for mechanical support. There are far too few remaining pins for even basic charlieplexing so I&rsquo;m guessing there&rsquo;s an integrated driver of some kind. Probably a <a href="https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/max7219-max7221.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">max7219</a> or similar</p>

<p>This is a quick <a href="/tags/two-minute-teardown/" rel="">#TwoMinuteTeardown</a> post for the recently released <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/voice-pe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Home Assistant Voice Node - Preview edition</a>.</p>
<p>Normally, I&rsquo;d be doing a full teardown, but this is a little different; the Home Assistant team has done a <em>lot</em> of the work out in the open.
With just a quick Google, you can find official:</p>
<ul>

<p>I am grateful for such a well-documented and open project.
Truly, by hackers for hackers!</p>
<h2 id="teardown">Teardown</h2>
<p>See the official instructions if you can&rsquo;t figure it out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much to the device, really.
The top half hosts the physical buttons and the microphones.
The thin, metal-looking piece in the top right is the antenna.</p>
<p>In the bottom right, there&rsquo;s a small switch that appears to mux between the main application processor (ESP32) and the audio processor.</p>
<p>I wonder weather this is &ldquo;leftover&rdquo; from development and they haven&rsquo;t gotten around to simplifying the BOM yet or if this is intentionally populated for users to re-program the audio processor.</p>

<p>All of the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; stuff is on the bottom half.</p>
<p>Immediately, you notice the PCB has multiple <em>populated</em> pin headers for hacking. Bonus, they&rsquo;re all labeled!</p>
<p>The layout and BOM is about what you&rsquo;d expect for a ~$50 single-purpose device.</p>
<p>Where possible, I&rsquo;ve <a href="#ics" rel="">identified</a> the big ICs.</p>

<h3 id="wishful-thinking">wishful thinking</h3>
<p>In a word: Ethernet.</p>
<p>Most of the ESP32 product line does not have support for ethernet via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media-independent_interface#RMII" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">RMII</a> (unfortunately) but there is always SPI based ethernet.</p>
<p>There are a few areas where the PCB is bare/empty and with a few tweaks to the layout, it would have been possible to also expose SPI headers next to the <a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-I2C_Hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">grove connector</a>.</p>
<p>Assuming there&rsquo;s a spare SPI peripheral to use, SPI based ethernet would have latency and throughput as good as or better than WiFi.</p>
<p>It would have been a nice option for those of us who prefer the reliability of wired connections.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<h2 id="ics">ICs</h2>
<p>This is just the big ones that were going to be easy-ish to positively identify.
I skipped a few of the super small ICs that had a few characters (at most!) of identification on them.</p>
<p>Two flash chips, one for the ESP32 and one for the &ldquo;ai&rdquo; chip which is maybe doing detection and is almost certainly doing some other DSP stuff.
TI parts for the audio codec and a few miscellaneous bits as well.</p>

The product name and datasheet suggest that it&rsquo;s instrumental in &ldquo;ai&rdquo; workloads 🙄 but the datasheet is a bit more concrete:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The xcore.ai series is a comprehensive range of 32-bit multicore microcontrollers that brings the low latency and timing determinism of the xCORE architecture to mainstream embedded applications.
Unlike conventional microcontrollers, xCORE multicore microcontrollers execute multiple real-time tasks simultaneously and communicate between tasks using a high speed network.
Because xCORE multicore microcontrollers are completely deterministic when executing from internal memory, you can write software to implement functions that traditionally require dedicated hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is doing real time audio processing - presumably to cancel background noise/echo - and might also be doing wake word detection.</p>

<p>In the same spirit as <a href="/extending-the-mk3s-print-area/" rel="">an earlier post</a>, here is a quick hack I used to get my <strong>dual</strong>-headed Prusa XL printer to print with <strong>three</strong> materials at once.</p>
<p>While the technique worked, it may not be the best method, so proceed with caution.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>I am trying to print a part that requires two different materials at the same time: ABS and TPU.</p>
<figure >

    
        
        

    

    <figcaption>
        
        <p>
            The shaded blue area is meant to be TPU/FLEX material. The shaded yellow area is meant to be ABS material.
            
                
                
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The first complication comes from the &ldquo;unfriendly&rdquo; shape; the part is spherical and has no ideal orientation for printing without any supports.</p>
<figure >

    
        
        

    

    <figcaption>
        
        <p>
            Grey is TPU, Green is ABS, and the Blue/Grey mix is the support material composed of interleaved PLA and TPU layers.
            
                
                
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>To make matters slightly more complicated, TPU is one of those filaments that likes to stick to pretty much everything; I have few good options for support material.
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VV2fbJ0apg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "><em>least</em> sticky material</a> is PLA.</p>
<p>So now I have a single job that requires three materials: ABS, TPU, and PLA&hellip;. but still only two print heads to work with.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>Usually when faced with the &ldquo;more materials than heads&rdquo; problem, the solution is to use the <a href="https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M600.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "><code>M600</code></a> gCode command to have the printer pause, eject the current material and wait for the user to load the new material.</p>
<p>This technique is not new; it&rsquo;s widely supported and works perfectly <strong>if</strong> the materials are similar enough that the extrusion settings can be shared between them.</p>
<p>For my part, the tool head will have to transition from <code>PLA</code> to <code>ABS</code> which means virtually every instruction in the gCode will have to change as well.</p>
<h2 id="the-loophole">The loophole</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the geometry for this part has a &ldquo;gap&rdquo; between the initial section where supports are needed and the internal section where the ABS material is needed.</p>
<figure >

    
        
        

    

    <figcaption>
        
        <p>
            This is the &#39;per-layer&#39; view from the slicer with a &#39;bottom-up&#39; perspective. As before, Grey is TPU, Green is ABS, and the thin blue circle represents the topmost layer of the support material.
            
                
                
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Notice that the <em>last</em> support layer (blue circle) is still a few layers away from the first ABS layer (the green section).</p>
<p>Essentially, I do need three materials, <strong>but only two at a time</strong>.
What a coincidence that I have a printer with two heads!</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-hack">The <del>solution</del> hack</h2>
<div class="details admonition warning open">
        <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
            <i class="icon fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>Warning<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content"><p>This is a hack and may not work for all printers or all slicers.
Think of this more as a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; than a reliable technique.
You can likely adapt this technique to other printers but you will need to understand the gCode generated by your slicer and the firmware running on your printer.</p>
<p>Ideally, this serves as a demonstration and inspires the development of a more robust solution; conceivably, the prusa slicer/firmware could be modified to support this use case directly with not much effort.</p>
</div>
        </div>
    </div>
<p>The solution is to lie to the slicer and tell it that I have three tool heads.
This way, I can use correct profiles for each material and the slicer will generate the correct gCode for each material.</p>
<p>All I have to do is post-process the gCode to pause for a manual material swap at the correct time and then replace all references to the third tool head with the second tool head after the swap.</p>
<p>Simple, right?</p>
<p>(yes, but not as simple as I thought)</p>
<p>This particular part has a little over 400K lines of gCode so I&rsquo;m not going to do this by hand!
Here&rsquo;s a quick and dirty Python script that rewrote the gCode for me:</p>

<p>The printer was - somehow - aware that the gCode wanted three heads with three distinct materials and refused to start the print until I added a third head.</p>
<p>As it turns out, that python script isn&rsquo;t quite enough to fool the printer.
I&rsquo;ll spare you from the many iterative attempts to get this working and say that the following additional optimizations/deletions were necessary:</p>

</div><p>As best as I can tell, there&rsquo;s a few hundred lines that encode some basic metadata about the part(s) and the filament(s) used / print times and the slicer specific configuration information.
If you look closely, you can see that a fair number of properties have three values: one for each tool head:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">&lt;...&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>I spent a few iterations trying to identify what each property did and if it was safe to drop the third value but wasn&rsquo;t making a ton of progress.
Eventually I just decided to drop <em>all</em> of the metadata&hellip; and that worked!</p>
<p>Initially I didn&rsquo;t think that the printer firmware would be reading <em>ANY</em> of the <strong>commented out</strong> sections of the file but I guess this makes sense for metadata and anything else that&rsquo;s not a gCode instruction.</p>
<p>As best as I can tell, nothing contained in the metadata sections changes how the actual print is executed.
All of the values are for the slicer UI and - in some cases - for the printer firmware to sanity check the gCode before starting the print.</p>
<p>I could be wrong about this but I don&rsquo;t have the time/patience/resources to properly test this. The gCode works well enough for my needs without the metadata so I&rsquo;m content to move on to the next steps on this project.</p>
<p>If I am wrong about what the metadata sections do and it turns out that they do help refine/improve how the printer firmware processes instructions&hellip;please do let me know!</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>If you have a need to print with more materials than you have tool heads, you <strong>might</strong> be able to trick the slicer/printer into re-configuring a print head mid-print.</p>
<p>To do this, get the slicer to generate valid and correct gCode for each material/tool head combination as if you had an appropriately configured printer.
After the gCode has been generated, map every &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; too head to a real tool head and remove any additional references to the virtual tool heads.</p>

<p>During China&rsquo;s Single&rsquo;s Day sale on AliExpress, I bought various gadgets - both for projects and out of curiosity.

<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for a better scene controller/switch/Home Assistant interface.
I was curious about which chip they used for the full graphics display and was hoping for an easily hackable Android device.
Unfortunately, no such luck with this.</p>
<p>The main application processor is <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/F1C100s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "><code>F1C100s</code></a> which is a low-cost, low-power, ARM9-based SoC.
It might be able to run a custom Linux build that could draw a custom UI, but it&rsquo;s not going to be as easy as rooting an Android device.</p>
<p>There’s not much in the box, just the switch and a manual.

<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty standard &ldquo;power supply and relays in the back, touch screen in the front&rdquo; design.
This time, though, there&rsquo;s an <em>exposed</em> programming header!?</p>

<p>The power supply doesn&rsquo;t look too bad.

<p>As the USB-C PD standard matures and GaN technology makes high-power chargers cheaper, it&rsquo;s fun to see the internals get more complex but also more integrated.
This was less than $15 shipped which is <em>insane</em> for a 100W+ charger unless they cut corners somewhere&hellip;</p>

<p>Other than that, it&rsquo;s about what you&rsquo;d expect from a modern USB-C charger that isn&rsquo;t hyper-compact; beefy looking AC-to-DC converter, a few big caps and then the USB-C PD controller.</p>
<p>Between each group of ports is a series of passives, some beefy looking power MOSFETs and a protocol negotiation IC.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, they used a micro USB port for charging.
This is <em>inexcusable</em> in 2024.
The silk screen on the PCB indicates that the design is from late 2020, which would be slightly more acceptable if USB-C wasn’t already the standard by then.
Furthermore, this device doesn’t need any complicated USB-C PD features, so it’s not like they’d have to worry about the extra cost or complexity of a USB-C controller.
Really, all they needed was <em>two</em> (very important, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/07/16/exploring-the-raspberry-pi-4-usb-c-issue-in-depth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "><strong>NOT</strong> ONE</a>) 5.1k resistors and a USB-C port and they could have been future proofed!</p>

<p>They scrubbed the markings off the SOIC16 CPU. The rest of the components are about what you’d expect for managing lithium batteries, switching the fan, and driving the boost converter for the ozone generator.</p>
<p>It appears another version of this device also features a buzzer.
I&rsquo;m not sure what for, but the silk screen clearly shows a spot for it.</p>

I have some <a href="#side-note-the-ossha-community-is-being-heard" rel="">thoughts</a> on the state of the LED controller market, but to summarize: it&rsquo;s <em>getting better</em>!</p>

<p>Yep, the ESP32 is on a separate PCB that&rsquo;s connected to the main board via a header.
The silk screen on the PCB makes me think that this was <em>initially</em> developed for an ESP8266 but then they added the header for the ESP32 module late(?) in design.</p>

<p>Because this is an &ldquo;addressable&rdquo; LED controller, there&rsquo;s not much to look at.
The GPIO from the ESP goes more or less directly to the output pins.</p>

<p>I saved the <em>best</em> for last!
This LED controller <em>really</em> did surprise me with how open it is!</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not putting a generic &ldquo;ESP32 powered&rdquo; message on the label leaving the reader to read between the lines / infer that the device can be flashed with alternate firmware.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re straight up saying so!
The label has the GPIO pins clearly labeled.
It uses USB-C for power and flashing.
The USB port is <em>modern</em> unlike <a href="#generic-ozone-generator-xd001" rel="">other</a> devices I&rsquo;ve <a href="#gledepto-gl-c-015wl-d-led-controller" rel="">shown</a> in this post.
The USB port can also be used for programming and isn&rsquo;t hidden!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to hoping that they release a version for analog LED strips! 🤞</p>

<h3 id="side-note-the-ossha-community-is-being-heard">side note: the OSS/HA community is being heard</h3>
<p>Over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve been scouring AliExpress to find the latest and greatest in LED controllers and every year I&rsquo;ve been disappointed.
But over the last year or so, I&rsquo;ve noticed a <em>huge</em> uptick in the number of controllers that are <em>actually</em> compatible with Home Assistant and other open-source home automation systems.</p>
<p>In the beginning, they were all ESP8266 based and trivial to reverse engineer and flash.
Then they started using TuYa intermediate MCUs which were a bit more tedious to reverse engineer but still possible if you were willing to put in the effort.</p>
<p>Now, they&rsquo;re using ESP32 based chips and going out of their way to LABEL which GPIOs go to which pin(s) and to generally make it TRIVIAL to flash WLED or ESPHome or whatever you want.</p>
<p>This means some savvy manufacturers are paying attention and recognizing the growing hobbyist market for these devices and are catering to them.
There&rsquo;s somebody out there that&rsquo;s not going to force their garbage app/api on you and is going to let you do whatever you want with the device you bought.
This was UNHEARD OF just a few years ago and I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> happy to see it happening now!</p>

<p>And the winner of the &ldquo;feels most like a hand-built prototype&rdquo; award goes to&hellip; this thing!</p>
<p>Normally I don&rsquo;t like it when screws are hidden under labels / stickers&hellip; but in this case, the &ldquo;sticker&rdquo; is a rubber foot that doesn&rsquo;t even &ldquo;hide&rdquo; the screws.</p>

<p>Looking from the side, the construction becomes pretty clear; it&rsquo;s probably just using a PCB for the heating element and the stacked PCBs separated with little brass standoffs is for thermal isolation.</p>

<p>USB-C for power is <em>always</em> a good sign.
Other than that, a basic <a href="https://www.mcu.com.cn/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">CMSemicon</a> IC runs the show.</p>

<p>USB-C &ldquo;expansion&rdquo; docs are a dime a dozen now.
This caught my attention because of the LCD display on the side.
What are the odds that it presents as a second display using <a href="https://www.displayport.org/displayport-over-usb-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">display port tunneling</a> via usb-alt mode?</p>

<p>It looks like a pretty straightforward de-mux and breakout PCB.
The display is an isolated / standalone component that&rsquo;s linked to the main PCB with just 4 wires.
What are the odds that it&rsquo;s hanging off a USB hub?</p>

<p>The silk screen markings make me think that the &ldquo;internal&rdquo; name for this product is <code>K0108-1D</code>.
Interesting that the <code>HUB</code> PCB has a date code almost a full <em>year</em> after the <code>LCD</code> PCB..
Also worth noting; the instructions that came with the device link to the same shady <code>key123.vip</code> site that the <a href="#ajazz-akp03e-stream-deck-clone" rel="">ajazz</a> used so there&rsquo;s <em>definitely</em> some sort of relationship between the two but I&rsquo;m not sure what it is.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, they lasered off the markings on the display module.
I don&rsquo;t have a clip for the eeprom, but I bet that there&rsquo;d be at least a few interesting strings in there :D.</p>

<p>After seeing that the LCD is just a standalone module, I wanted to see how it presented itself to the host.
As expected, it&rsquo;s just a USB hub with a few devices hanging off it.
The display module is almost certainly the HID device.</p>

I was curious to see if they did anything differently than the original for the internal hardware.
Turns out, no.
It&rsquo;s still a basic LCD screen behind a matrix of clear buttons.</p>
<p>The unit can be easily separated from its stand and there are no hidden screws!</p>

<p>The <code>-VxNx</code> suffix on the silk screen matches the silk screen seen on the <a href="#generic-usb-c-dock-w-lcd" rel="">USB-C Dock</a>&hellip; which really does make me think that there&rsquo;s some sort of relationship between the two products.</p>
<p>The board with the physical knobs/buttons is just a &ldquo;pass through&rdquo; PCB; everything here just goes right over the FFC to the board with the screen and buttons.</p>

<p>The software is <em>super</em> sketchy; just trying to find a build that actually worked on macOS was a pain!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.a-jazz.com/en/search.jsp?id=422&amp;q=03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">official site</a> looks and functions like it was made with a 2000s-era website builder 🤮.</p>
<p>With some google-fu, I found links to a <a href="https://bbs.key123.vip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">web forum</a> that may not be officially related to the product, but <a href="https://bbs.key123.vip/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=1167&amp;highlight=AKP03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">has some download links</a> to software that is supposed to work with the device, on macOS in English.</p>
<p>I never got a working build of the software, but the few builds that I did try all have the same architecture; a <code>Qt</code> app that hosts plugins and does all of the thinking for the device.</p>
<p>With a bit more digging, I think that this &ldquo;Mirabox&rdquo; company is the underlying OEM and the ajazz is just a white-labeled version of this product: <a href="https://miraboxbuy.com/collections/stream-dock/products/streamdock-mbox-n3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Stream Dock MBox 293N3</a>.</p>
<p>Mirabox also appears to have a <a href="https://sdk.key123.vip/en/guide/overview.html#stream-dock-mbox-293n4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">fledgling SDK</a> for plugins <em>and</em> a <a href="https://github.com/MiraboxSpace/Linux-StreamDock-PythonSDK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Python SDK</a> for Linux users!</p>
<h3 id="usb-details-1">USB details</h3>
<p>Similar architecture; USB hub with two HID devices hanging off it; probably one HID for reading the buttons and another for writing to the screen.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for a &ldquo;Works with Home Assistant&rdquo; version of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Wall-Clock---An-Echo-companion-to-see-timers-at-a-glance./dp/B07FQDMKFT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Echo Wall Clock</a> ever since Amazon discontinued it.</p>
<p>I was hoping this would be a simple ESP8266 or ESP32 module linked directly to the LEDs&hellip; but there&rsquo;s an anonymous intermediate microcontroller in there.</p>
<p>Assuming that the microcontroller can be removed easily and the various segments of addressable LEDs can be driven directly from an ESP8266 or ESP32, this could still be a viable base for a custom LED wall clock.</p>

<p>As was the case with the other LCD modules, this looks like it&rsquo;s just USB 2.0 module hanging off a USB hub.
Conceivably, you could embed a tiny raspberry pi zero or other <em>small</em> computer with USB Host support inside this thing 🤔&hellip;</p>

<p>The two internal PCBs are marked very similarly to the <a href="#generic-usb-c-dock-w-lcd" rel="">USB-Dock</a> <em>and</em> the <a href="#ajazz-akp03e-stream-deck-clone" rel="">Stream Deck clone</a> which really does make me think that mirabox is the ODM for those products as well.</p>
<p>Markings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HSV293-N4-LCD</p>
<p>20240807</p>
<p>HSV293-N4-SW</p>
<p>202400711</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the USB hub PCB in the base doesn&rsquo;t have a part number, just a date code.
I&rsquo;d bet that they started designing this product in spring of 2024 and they finished the simplest part - the USB hub - first.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick &ldquo;show-and-tell&rdquo; about a recent project I completed.</p>
<h2 id="the-concept">The concept</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how I first came across the idea of measuring air pressure drop across a filter to gauge its remaining life, but I remember thinking it was a great idea.</p>
<figure >

        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The idea has been lurking in the back of my mind for a while, but I never got around to implementing it&hellip; until now.</p>
<p>Years ago, I added a <a href="https://www.winsen-sensor.com/sensors/co2-sensor/mh-z16.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">CO₂ sensor</a> to my HVAC return duct to monitor indoor air quality.
While the sensor provided useful data, I was never really satisfied with how quickly it was installed (read: hacked together messy prototype), and I always wanted to improve it.</p>
<p>While browsing AliExpress for an unrelated project, I stumbled upon some differential air pressure probes and decided to buy one of these <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807382388280.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">sensors</a>.</p>
<p>After an afternoon of work, I had the sensor up and running and could <a href="https://github.com/kquinsland/qdx50d-air-pressure-sensor-poc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">communicate with it using some simple Python</a>.</p>
<p>I then designed a PCB to integrate the sensors and electronics and 3D-printed a case to house the whole setup.</p>

Use this as a starting point and adapt it to your needs.</div>

<p>At a high level, the BOM for the project includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>ESP32-C3 mini module</li>
<li>Bosch BME680 sensor / Co2 sensor</li>
<li>QDX50D air pressure sensor</li>
<li>AC to DC power supply for interfacing with existing 24VAC HVAC power</li>
<li>Custom PCB</li>
</ul>
<p>The assembled setup looks like this:</p>

<p>Below is a snippet of the ESPHome configuration file for this project. It’s similar to my configuration, but I&rsquo;ve removed boilerplate sections (e.g., <code>mqtt</code>, <code>wifi</code>, etc.) for brevity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve included numerous in-line comments to clarify each section. To briefly recap:</p>

<li>Press the &ldquo;Clear High Water Mark&rdquo; button whenever you change the filter to reset the high water mark.</li>
<li>Ensure that <code>glbl_air_pressure_delta_clogged_pa</code> and <code>glbl_air_pressure_delta_virgin_pa</code> fields contain values tailored to your system.</li>
<li>To calibrate these values, install a new filter and note the value reported by <code>sense_air_pressure_delta_raw_pa</code>. As the filter clogs over time, this value will rise. When the filter blocks most light when held up to a bright light, it’s time for a replacement. Record the value of <code>sense_air_pressure_delta_raw_pa</code> at this point and use it as the &ldquo;clogged&rdquo; threshold.</li>

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="c"># Knowing that the pressure delta will only increase as the filter gets clogged, we can compare the current air pressure delta</span><span class="w">

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="c"># So, this means that we need to supply two calibration values for most of the code below to work properly:</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="c">#   - The pressure drop across a virgin / brand new filter. This value should be adjusted if the type of filter</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="c">#       is changed (e.g. MERV 8 to MERV 13). This value can be obtained &#34;automatically&#34; by just installing a new filter and</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="c">#       clicking the &#34;reset high-water mark&#34; button. The next time that the fan runs, the probe will record the highest value</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="c">#       and this is a good estimate of the virgin value. Maybe round down just a bit to be safe.</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="c">#   - The pressure drop across an end-of-life/clogged filter. The best way to get this value is to use a filter that&#39;s</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="c">#       about to be replaced. In testing, the difference between a new filter and a clogged filter was about 20-30 hPa</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="c">#       so it is possible to estimate this value if you only have the virgin value. If using the estimation approach, check the</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="c">#       filter from time to time to see how dirty it is and adjust the clogged value as needed. Once the filter is so dirty that</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="c">#       you can&#39;t see sunlight through it, it&#39;s probably time to replace it. Record the high water marker value at this time</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="c">#       and use that as the clogged value. Maybe round down just a bit to be safe.</span><span class="w">

<p>This is a quick project to create a wearable RFID fob that can be easily attached to a watch band.
The idea is to have a small RFID tag that can be used for various purposes, such as access control or identification that is - more or less - as convenient as a surgically implanted tag, but without the need for embedding anything in your body.</p>
<p>I was inspired by both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microchip_implant_%28human%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">bio-hacking community</a> and the medical-alert &lsquo;accessory bands&rsquo; for Android Wear devices.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t mind the few small print imperfections; <em>this was a prototype</em> printed with a .6mm nozzle.
A final version of this would be printed with a smaller nozzle, a finer layer height and probably a different color/material.</p>
<p>The point is to have a small, unobtrusive design that can be easily attached to a watch band.
Because of the wide variety of watch bands available, I have <a href="#files" rel="">included</a> the raw Fusion360 file for you to modify as needed.</p>

<h2 id="bill-of-materials">Bill of Materials</h2>
<p>The core component of this project is the <a href="#sourcing-the-rfid-tag" rel="">RFID tag</a> which needs to be small and reprogrammable.</p>
<p>Other than that, you will need to design or print your own enclosure and secure it to the watch band with a standard pin.
Sourcing these is quite easy; a local watch shop or jeweler should have them available or you can buy a watch-band kit online.
A kit is advisable if you need to prototype multiple designs / play with different pin diameters/lengths.</p>
<p>Printing the tag enclosure is straightforward but due to it&rsquo;s small size, the more precise your printer is, the better the results will be.</p>

<h2 id="sourcing-the-rfid-tag">Sourcing the RFID tag</h2>
<p>This application is severely space constrained, so you need the smallest possible tag that is also reprogrammable.
If you search for tags meant to be embedded under the skin of animals, you will find many options&hellip; but they are not reprogrammable.</p>
<p>There are also tags meant for <a href="https://dangerousthings.com/category/implants/x-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">humans</a> but they&rsquo;re not cheap!
I did eventually find a suitable tag on eBay:</p>
