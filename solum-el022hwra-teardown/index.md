# Solum 2.2 inch Electronic Shelf Label Teardown


# Quick peek inside the EL029F3WRA

In light of the recent news that the [OpenEPaperLink](https://github.com/jjwbruijn/OpenEPaperLink) firmware has been [ported to the `nRF52811`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph5BXFcugC4) series of chips, I decided to take a look inside the Solum EL029F3WRA to see if it was a viable candidate for a project.

As it turns out, it is very similar to the [2.9 inch](https://github.com/jjwbruijn/OpenEPaperLink/wiki/2.9%22-EL029H3WRA) tags.
I hope to soon have a simple CAD model of the ESL which I'll use to model a basic pogo-pin programming jig for this particular ESL.

DO NOT DO THIS.

The PCB **can** be pried out of the case but doing so will likely damage the eInk panel unless you apply pressure equally from multiple corners.

The glass on the eInk panel is very thin and far less flexible than the PCB.
Note the crack...
