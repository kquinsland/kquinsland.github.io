# Using ESPHome to Automatically restart frozen cable modem

<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD002 -->

Part of the reason for developing my [SB8200 monitor]({{< relref "posts/2024/03/arris-sb8200-prometheus-exporter" >}}) was to get to the bottom of some infrequent but regular outages.

To make a long story short, the [LAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation) implementation on the modem seems to have some issues.
A quick google will return many complaint threads detailing issues with the modem regularly locking up all traffic stopping.
More annoyingly, these reports date back _years_ and allege that later revisions of the firmware _might_ fix the issue for good.

My ISP is [evil](https://deadline.com/2014/09/netflix-discovery-response-comcast-extortion-840530) and doesn't give me a way to check for or manually update the firmware on device.

As expected, their stance is that all my issues will go away if I rent  _their_ modem and let them up-sell me a faster service tier, though ðŸ™„.

When the modem falls over, it's pretty sudden; things will be fine one moment and then no traffic flows the next.
The exact timing seems to vary a bit, but the average time between lockups is about 10 days with very little variance.

I've been "lucky" in the sense that most of these lockups have happened during the day while I was at home; I could notice the issue, triage and fix it pretty quickly.
My dashboards have at most 300 seconds of down time or so.

There's only so much luck to go around, though; what happens when I'm out of the house?I've been thinking about how to automate the process of restarting the modem and this is what I came up with.

## The "fix"

My modem is powered through a [Sonoff S31 plug](https://devices.esphome.io/devices/Sonoff-S31) running [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/).

Every 10 seconds, the S31 tries to fetch the modem's http interface using the [`http_request`](https://esphome.io/components/http_request.html) component.
If - after 2 seconds - the modem doesn't respond, a counter is incremented.
Once the counter reaches 5 consecutive failures, the power to the modem is briefly interrupted just as if I had unplugged it, counted to 10 and plugged it back in.

To make this bit of ESPHome configuration re-usable, I've packaged up the functionality into a pair of standalone files that can be included into an existing ESPHome configuration.

Documentation for why/how things work has been put in the comments of each file to aid understanding.

### `base.yaml`

This implements 95% of the logic and everything that's not implementation specific:

```yaml

  poll_interval_seconds: "10"

  # How many failed requests before we take action
  # If polling happens every 10 seconds and runs for at most 2 seconds then
  # 5 failures in a row would mean that the host has been in a failed state for
  # somewhere between 50 and 60 seconds before we take action.

### All together now

Hopefully it's clear to see that `modem.yaml` wraps/includes `base.yaml`.
This is how `modem.yaml` is injected into the existing configuration that I have deployed on the S31 powering my modem.

```yaml
# See: https://esphome.io/guides/configuration-types.html#packages
packages:
  # Omitted: common packages for Network info, NTP, OTA, MQTT, 
  #   relay/gpio and other device specific things... etc

  # Add http polling configured for this specific application
  http_poll: !include packages/http_poll/modem.yaml

logger:
  #  <...>
  logs:
    # ESPHome considers anything not 200/OK as a failure and will WARN about it.
    # See: https://github.com/esphome/esphome/blob/38b7bed2faa522e7e065d8362d6ea0bcaf1c64d5/esphome/components/http_request/http_request.cpp#L92
    # This is technically correct but results in log spam that is not useful to me.
    # For my purposes, hearing anything back from the modem (302 or 200) counts as a success.
    # Silence log spam by hiding all http_request log lines unless they're ERROR level
    http_request: ERROR

button:
  # Note: must not conflict with the button named "Restart" which reboots the ESP, not toggles the relay!
