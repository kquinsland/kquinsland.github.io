# Inside the Pulse-Eight HDMI CEC Injector

To make a long store short, Google recently pushed a few updates to my TV that made it slow as all hell and frustratingly unusable.
I finally got fed up with the laggy UI and dug out an old mini PC and installed [LibreELEC](https://libreelec.tv/) on it.

Everything worked perfectly _except_ for the lack of [CEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Control) support on the mini PC.

This is a common enough problem that there's a few different devices out there that can add CEC support to a device that doesn't have it.
I chose the [Pulse-Eight HDMI CEC Injector](https://www.pulse-eight.com/p/104/usb-hdmi-cec-adapter) because it's natively supported by LibreELEC.

I was curious what was inside and I couldn't find any teardowns online so I decided to do one myself.
There's not much to the device and I'm not doing any serious reverse engineering here so let's call this a ["Two Minute Teardown"]({{<relref "/tags/two-minute-teardown/">}}).

I wasn't expecting much; I thought CEC was implemented via UART and not SPI so I was expecting to see a cheap FTDI knockoff chip or similar.
Turns out I was wrong and the device uses an [ATMEL 90USB162](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/at90usb162) which is a USB to SPI bridge.
I haven't looked too closely at the [firmware](https://github.com/Pulse-Eight/libcec) but I suspect there's some abstraction layer that makes it look like a [UART](#dmesg) to the OS.
