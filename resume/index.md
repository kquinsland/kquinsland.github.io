# Resume


# TL;DR

When asked to summarize my resume, ChatGPT said:

> Overall, the candidate is a highly skilled SRE with a passion for automation and optimization.

When asked to expand on that further I got back a summary that was accurate and concise:

> I am a Senior+ level engineer with a constellation of skills in the Dev/Sec-Ops and SRE space.
>
> An overall tool-smith leveraging a decade+ of cloud computing and software development experience to make both personal and professional tasks more automatic and consistent.
>
> My expertise includes designing and building modern, scalable architectures as well as the CI/CD pipelines to facilitate their deployment.
>
> I have also spent a decent amount of time modernizing legacy Terraform infrastructure, improving internal documentation and both developing and coaching incident management processes.
>
> I believe that quality documentation is one of an engineer's most valuable resources.
>
> I have a strong understanding of security in the application, infrastructure and organizational contexts. I have run vulnerability bounty programs and been responsible for triaging and prioritizing bounty-winning reports.
>
> I am an OSS contributor with a strong background in Python and am comfortable working with a range of technologies.
> I am particularly skilled at identifying opportunities for automation and building tools to streamline workflows.
> I enjoy using personal time to further develop my skills and build tools to automate tasks outside of work; my personal interests and skills often overlap with my professional expertise.
