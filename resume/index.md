# Resume

I used to curate a résumé as an excuse to learn [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/) but have found over the years that most positions don't actually look at the résumé, they look at the summary that their [ATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) generates _after_ ingesting the resume.

Not all ATS platforms can reliably ingest the PDF export from LinkedIn that has been my defacto resume since I stopped maintaining the LaTex version, so I offer my résumé in a few formats for other workflows/needs.

The files linked below should be considered the most up to date copy of my recent professional roles and accomplishments.

- [JSON](/resume/kq.json) document. Complies with the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) schema.
- [MARKDOWN](/resume/kq.md) document which can be easily turned into HTML or PDF if you so choose.
- [HTML](/resume/kq.html) document which can be easily turned into a PDF if you so choose.
- [PDF](/resume/kq.pdf) document which mirrors the HTML but has most formatting stripped out for reliable machine parsing.

You can also find a similar - but not identical or as current - copy of the information on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlq/).
