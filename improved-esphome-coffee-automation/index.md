# Integrating a dumb coffee maker with Home Assistant via ESPHome

<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD002 -->

My beloved coffee maker of 10 years has finally died ðŸ˜¢.
Parts are no longer available from either the manufacturer or the second-hand market.

Taking advantage of a (slight) holiday sale discount, I pulled the trigger on a coffee maker that's [designed to be repairable forever](https://us.moccamaster.com/pages/sustainability-at-our-core).
The perpetual serviceability is a side effect of an ultra-simple design; this coffee maker has _zero_ intelligent features which means there's next to no remote control or customizability.

## Adding Home Assistant integration

Fortunately, we can add a decent amount of control with a basic smart outlet.
Naturally, I went with the amazing Sonoff S31 but you can get similar results with _any_ ESPHome compatible device so long as you have a way to control power to the coffee maker and to monitor the power used by the coffee maker.

This borrows a technique that I first wrote about in [`Dynamic timers in ESPHome`]({{< relref "posts/2022/08/esphome-dynamic-timer" >}}) and tweaks it a bit to add of coffee-specific automations:

- Run the boiler for a moment, then pause. This is to let the [coffee bloom](https://www.homegrounds.co/coffee-bloom/).
- Turn relay off automatically after a period of no power use. This is done locally for safety and to save me the hassle of putting a template "is coffee brewing" sensor in home assistant. I still report energy data to home assistant for statistical purposes but don't use the data for automations.

Here's what that looks like:

### ESPHome

Below is a simplified ESPHome configuration file that resembles what I use "in production".
As is, you'll need to fill it out / add in your own versions of some of the unique-to-me details intentionally omitted; these will be the device/component `id:` values, mostly.

```yaml
substitutions:
  friendly_name: "Mr. Coffee"
  friendly_name_short: "Coffee"

  # How long do we run the heater for?
  # The time from power on to first water in basket depends on water temperature.
  # The cooler the water, the longer it'll be.
  # For now, the intent is to use other sensors to estimate the water temp and have HA
  #   update the configuration before starting a brew.
  #
  # Maybe in a future version, outfit with water level/temp probe directly.

### Home Assistant automations

When some automation determines that it's now time to start making coffee, this is a portion of the script that is executed:

```yaml

sequence:
  # ...
- service: number.set_value
    data:
      # This is a bit simplified; my template does some more maths to map the temperature to a more precise value.
      # I simplified the value template here to illustrate how the adjustable timers are meant to be used.
      value: >-
        {% if states('sensor.kitchen_temperature')|float(-1) < 25 %}35{% else
        %}20{% endif %}
    target:
      entity_id: number.pre_bloom_time
  - service: number.set_value
    data:
      value: "35.0"
    target:
      entity_id: number.bloom_time
  - type: turn_on
    device_id: #< Your Device ID Here >
    entity_id: switch.coffee_power
    domain: switch
```
