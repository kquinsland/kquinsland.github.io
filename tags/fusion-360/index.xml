He&amp;rsquo;s managed to arrange some relatively cheap commodity hardware into a package that conveniently fits into a prime location for interacting with Home Automation - the light switch. The entire package sips power off of the already present mains wiring and connects to any MQTT broker via the esp8266 chip. As the HASP was designed to be used with Home Assistant, the humble 2.4 inch LCD transforms into an accessible control surface for an incredibly powerful home automation platform!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within moments of discovering the project and browsing through a few examples, my mind ran wild with possibilities. After double checking the relatively low &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate#bill-of-materials">B.O.M.&lt;/a> cost,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While shopping for the parts to make my own version, I got a few ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
If the LEDs weren&amp;#39;t on, you&amp;#39;d never know they were there 😊
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="modifications">Modifications&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, a brief word about indemnification:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>All instructions and information on this page is purely for informational purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original HASP and my modifications come with neither an expressed or implied warranty. By constructing your own, you assume all risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="software">Software&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The few software modifications I&amp;rsquo;ve made to the HASP project are relatively small and don&amp;rsquo;t implement anything significant or new; they are &amp;lsquo;quality of life&amp;rsquo; improvements that target small portions of the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I strongly believe that the hardest part of using a given piece automation technology should be taking it out of the box. To wit, Home Assistant has robust - &lt;a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/ability-to-set-entity-icon-through-mqtt-discovery/224538">but not perfect&lt;/a> - support for &lt;a href="Https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/">automatic device discovery and configuration via MQTT&lt;/a>. Once a device has connected to the MQTT broker, it simply publishes a document detailing how HA should interface with the device. It&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful experience to see a new device connect to the network for the first time and just a few seconds later the new device is registered in HA, waiting for you to start integrating it into automations 🤩🤤.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While there are quite a few sensors/stateful-attributes in the original HASP code, none of them automatically present themselves to Home Assistant 😔. I set about fixing that to the best of my abilities. Unfortunately, the LCD backlight is the only peripheral that could be &amp;lsquo;upgraded&amp;rsquo; to automatic configuration without making a ton of changes to the original code base.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of the hardware modifications detailed below automatically configure themselves with Home Assistant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original HASP code base uses allocates too little memory for storing MQTT credentials. Any username or password longer than 31 bytes/characters would be &lt;strong>silently&lt;/strong> truncated on save. Despite the &amp;lsquo;credentials saved, rebooting&amp;rsquo; message, the next screen was always a &amp;lsquo;failure to connect&amp;rsquo; message. Frustrating! The pull request to address this is &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/pull/117">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hardware">Hardware&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The HASP does support dimming the LCD, but it has no awareness of ambient light levels. This makes it rather difficult to deploy a HASP in any &amp;lsquo;light sensitive&amp;rsquo; location like a bedroom or media room without another device to cue Home Assistant and lower the LCD brightness. Workable, but too high friction to be ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Light Dependent Resistors - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor">LDR&lt;/a> for short - are a very cheap and compact way to get an approximate light level. Fortunately, the analogue pin is broken out on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/tree/master/PCB">PCB&lt;/a> so a simple &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider#Resistive_divider">resistive divider&lt;/a> and a few lines of code are all that&amp;rsquo;s needed to get a a number that linearly correlates to the level of light hitting the face plate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It just so happens that there is &lt;em>just enough&lt;/em> room to fit a LDR beneath the surface of the decor plate and out of the way of the LCD. As (not) shown in the picture above, there is no way to tell that the LDR is embedded beneath the surface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The range of values from the LDR isn&amp;rsquo;t great, but they are adequate enough to reliably detect if the HASP is in a darkened room.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
ignore the spikes just before noon, those are due to to testing with a flash light
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>While researching potential ways to measure the ambient brightness, I stumbled across the &lt;a href="https://shop.homeseer.com/products/z-wave-dimmer-switch">HomeSeer HS-WD200+&lt;/a> which features a rather novel way to convey additional information to a user; seven RGB leds 😍. It&amp;rsquo;s a brilliant use of such a simple and ubiquitous technology that I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure why every smart switch doesn&amp;rsquo;t do this!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/HS-WD200-Modes.jpg" alt="Picture showing tools/materials required for assembly" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
HomeSeer&amp;#39;s WS200 has a delightful innovation... RGB LEDs!
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>With &lt;em>zero&lt;/em> room to spare, four LEDs can fit into a small cavity between the LCD and decor plate surface. Like with the LDR, there is no visual &amp;lsquo;tell&amp;rsquo; that there are LEDs beneath the surface&amp;hellip; unless they&amp;rsquo;re on, of course.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/prototype-leds.jpg" alt="Picture showing a prototype HASP with LEDs embedded beneath the surface and powered on" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
Ignore the dirt on the switch. Notice how you can&amp;#39;t tell there&amp;#39;s an LDR beneath the surface
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h4 id="the-enclosure">The enclosure&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Without consuming more than 1 &lt;a href="https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/11654/what-does-1-gang-2-gang-and-so-forth-mean-when-talking-about-electrical-bo">gang&lt;/a>, the only realistic way to get the wires for the new components to the HASP PCB is to go around the edge of the LCD&amp;rsquo;s PCB. This is accomplished with two small &amp;lsquo;channels&amp;rsquo; that slightly protrude in the vertical directions from the lip around the LCD and into the box that encloses the electronics.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/CAD-channel-profile.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Fusion360, showing side profile of HASP, annotated to indicate channels in enclosure for wires leading to LED tape, LDR in relation to LCD" />

&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Additionally, I found that the original printed parts do not properly fit in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thomas-Betts-B232A-UPC-Carlon-Bulk/dp/B000GAWYZ8/">two gang electrical box&lt;/a> where I intended to deploy the HASP.&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
The only way to fit the HASP in my 2-gang electric boxes is to cut out a small section
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In total, the modifications required to accommodate the LDR and LED tape are relatively small, but &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/issues/116">I had to re-create the model from scratch&lt;/a> so several things are likely a bit different from the original model. It should be relatively easy to port the modifications to the other multi-gang configurations that the original HASP supports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>.step&lt;/code> and &lt;code>.f3z&lt;/code> files are available should you want to make the necessary modifications to other switch plate configurations.
The &lt;code>.stl&lt;/code> and &lt;code>.3mf&lt;/code> files are available for easy printing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All files available &lt;a href="#files">below&lt;/a> and on &lt;a href="https://github.com/kquinsland/HASwitchPlate/tree/master/3D_Printable_Models/enhanced-HASP">github&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="assembly">Assembly&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The steps below are meant to be followed between the original steps &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/blob/master/Documentation/03_Electronics_Assembly.md">&lt;code>03_Electronics_Assembly&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/blob/master/Documentation/04_Project_Enclosure.md">&lt;code>04_Project_Enclosure&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to assemble and test the HASP PCB as in the original instructions, but use the steps below as a substitute for the enclosure assembly process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="additional-materials">Additional Materials&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In addition to everything in the original BOM, you&amp;rsquo;ll need:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A LDR. Be aware that LDRs come in many different shapes and sizes and have different resistance values. Space is rather tight, so the form factor matters a lot more than the resistance values or band of light that the LDR responds to. If you use a different LDR, you may need to adjust the resistor value to better match your LDR. You can get 50 of the exact model GL5516 that I used for less than $2 &lt;a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_dUjV8Rn">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A 10KΩ resistor to form a simple resistive divider with the LDR. This will better map the the full range of the LDR to the 0-1 volt range that the ESP8266 ADC uses. Space is rather limited so the smaller the resistor, the better; no need for anything larger than 1/4 Watt. You can get a 10-pack of 10KΩ resistors &lt;a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F10-Pcs-1-8-Watt-1-Metal-Film-Resistor-Choose-you-own-values-USA-SELLER%2F302971259661&amp;amp;campid=5338745533&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;customid=">here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>WS2812B LED tape &lt;strong>featuring the 3535SMD package&lt;/strong>. The &amp;lsquo;regular size&amp;rsquo; LED package &lt;em>will &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> fit&lt;/em> so make sure you use the smaller &lt;code>3535SMD&lt;/code> package! Beyond that, aim for LED tape that is no wider than ~8mm and has highest density possible. After quite some searching, the best that I could find is 8mm wide tape with a density of 144 LEDs per meter. Unfortunately, they don&amp;rsquo;t sell LEDs 4 at a time, so you can pick up 1 meter of the exact LEDs I used &lt;a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FNarrow-DC-5V-WS2812B-Led-Strip-Individually-Addressable-WS2812-Led-pixel-Light%2F254647279915%3Fhash%3Ditem3b4a29212b%3Ag%3A9D8AAOSwIZ5fBTn7&amp;amp;campid=5338745533&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;customid=pixel_tape">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Several centimeters of very fine gauge wire. Ideally, multiple colors so you can keep organized but this is not required. Again, space is rather tight, so AWG 28 or 30 is ideal. Much bigger than that and you&amp;rsquo;ll likely have issues fitting everything together. You can get a 1m length of multiple colors &lt;a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FNarrow-DC-5V-WS2812B-Led-Strip-Individually-Addressable-WS2812-Led-pixel-Light%2F254647279915%3Fhash%3Ditem3b4a29212b%3Ag%3A9D8AAOSwIZ5fBTn7&amp;amp;campid=5338745533&amp;amp;toolid=10001">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>HeatShrink Tubing (HST). The exact diameter needed will depend on how compact your soldering is and the size of resistor used. Multiple colors will help keep things organized, but that&amp;rsquo;s not required. I suggest a kit so you can get the perfect diameter and length. You can get a kit &lt;a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F360pcs-2-1-Heat-Shrink-Tube-Tubing-Sleeving-Wrap-Wire-cable-Insulated-Assorted%2F224122863249%3Fhash%3Ditem342ec37e91%3Ag%3AMbcAAOSwXGhfPCNK&amp;amp;campid=5338745533&amp;amp;toolid=10001">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Standard 2.54mm pin headers. You can get a set of male and female headers &lt;a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F10pcs-Male-Header-1x40-2-54mm-40-Pin-PCB-Through-Hole-Arduino-and-Pi%2F223105297271%3Fepid%3D28022683725%26hash%3Ditem33f21cab77%3Ag%3A~X8AAOSwvFpbdZWA&amp;amp;campid=5338745533&amp;amp;toolid=10001">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>: Where possible, I&amp;rsquo;ve used commission links. The links don&amp;rsquo;t raise the price of any item, they simply let the retailer know that I&amp;rsquo;m the reason for your business. In return, I get a small cut of your purchase as a &amp;lsquo;thanks&amp;rsquo; from the retailer. If you&amp;rsquo;re not comfortable with that, you can use a URL unwinding service to get the &amp;lsquo;raw&amp;rsquo; product link and drop the attribution/commission part.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="brass-inserts">Brass inserts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The original instructions suggest using glue to secure the brass inserts to the face plate, but I suggest using either a lighter or a very fine tip soldering iron to heat up the brass insert. A hot insert will melt the surrounding plastic which will make for a much stronger joint. The modified version of the HASP face plate used in this guide intentionally features holes slightly too small for the brass inserts so glue won&amp;rsquo;t be enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fully insert the 20mm screw into the brass insert, use pliers to grasp the screw and apply heat with a lighter for a few seconds and then insert into the face plate. Make sure that the screw is &lt;strong>completely&lt;/strong> inserted into the insert so that molten plastic can&amp;rsquo;t flow into the insert. If molten plastic enters and cools on the threads, it will be rather difficult to later screw things together!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
Molten plastic can&amp;#39;t flow into a filled insert
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>As the inserts cool, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a few seconds to make adjustments to their orientation before they become fixed. Make sure that each screw is vertical and cool to the touch before moving on to the wiring harness.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are only six wires for the two components and the LED tape is the only component where polarity matters. A table mapping each pin on the HASP PCB to each component lead is below.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>You are &lt;strong>strongly&lt;/strong> encouraged to test / check your work after each step with a simple multimeter. Complete assembly involves irreversible steps, like shrinking HST. If you make a mistake, it&amp;rsquo;s best to catch it before &amp;lsquo;finalizing&amp;rsquo; things as you&amp;rsquo;re almost certainly going to have to destroy the component and or wiring harness to repair it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, you can flash my &lt;a href="https://github.com/kquinsland/HASwitchPlate">modified HASP firmware&lt;/a> to a fully assembled HASP device and use that as a testing device. On boot up, the modified firmware briefly flashes each LED in sequence. About every 10 seconds after boot, the LDR value will be read and published to MQTT. Cover the LDR with your hand and check your MQTT broker or HA to confirm that the value changes significantly between exposed and covered states.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="ldr">LDR&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Fit the LDR into the face plate and position the leads in the channel under and to the top of the LCD PCB. Then trim the excess length off of the LDR leads so that they extend &amp;lsquo;beyond&amp;rsquo; the LCD by about 8mm or so.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/assembly/03.ldr-position.jpg" alt="Picture showing the LDR in position under the LCD with it&amp;#39;s leads trimmed slightly" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
LDR under the LCD w/ trimmed leads...
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Remove the LDR from the face plate and straighten the leads out. Lay the LDR, resistor, and wire out as shown below. Use this time to cut the HST down to size so everything but the leg of the LDR that joins the resistor can be covered. &lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> the leads on the resistor have also been trimmed down to ~15mm to better fit.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s probably going to be easiest to start with the &amp;lsquo;supply&amp;rsquo; wire which runs directly from the HASP PCB&amp;rsquo;s +3.3v pin to the LDR. As space is exceedingly tight, there is no room for overly large solder joints. Carefully wrap the wire around the lead and apply just enough solder to make good electrical contact. Once the supply wire has been soldered to the LDR, affix the HST so the entirety of the lead and solder joint are protected.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
strip ~1cm off the end of the wire, wrap around the lead, then solder
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Repeat the same procedure with the lead of the resistor that will go directly to the ground. Affix the HST after the solder joint has cooled.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

No room for mechanically strong solder joints
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Use the same &amp;lsquo;wrap&amp;rsquo; technique with the remaining leads from the LDR and the resistor. Apply just enough solder for good electrical contact between the signal wire and the two leads of the LDR and resistor.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Set the LDR component aside for now and move on to the LED tape.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="leds">LEDs&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve not already trimmed the LED tape to fit in the face plate, do so now. Leave yourself as much room as needed to solder on the one side where you&amp;rsquo;ll need to feed power and data in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The LED tape has incredibly small pads so take your time on this. You have about 5 cubic millimeters &lt;em>total&lt;/em> for the three solder joints on the LED tape. Solder just enough for electrical contact, there will be no significant mechanical stress. &lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> The arrows printed on the strip point in the direction of data flow; combined with the off-center placement of the LED packages, there is only one way to properly install the LED tape in the decor plate.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>After soldering the power, signal and ground wires, flatten them and gently shape them so they align and flow into the channel on the face plate in a manner similar to the LDR. For a bit of mechanical robustness, consider braiding the wires together.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h5 id="pin-header">Pin Header&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>After soldering wires onto the two components, all that&amp;rsquo;s left is soldering the wires to the correct pins on the pin header.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One at a time, carefully take the pins out of the plastic &amp;lsquo;frame&amp;rsquo;. This is to prevent the heat from the soldering and HST steps from melting the plastic. Consider marking the pin with the location of the &amp;lsquo;frame&amp;rsquo; so you don&amp;rsquo;t take up too much room with the solder joint. You will need the &amp;lsquo;business end&amp;rsquo; of the pin to make good contact with the socket on the HASP board; this is quite difficult if most of the pin can&amp;rsquo;t be slid through the &amp;lsquo;frame&amp;rsquo; because of an excessively large solder joint!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/assembly/11.process.jpg" alt="picture showing single pin removed from pin header, about to be soldered" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
remove the pin from the plastic &amp;#39;frame&amp;#39; and carefully solder the wires to the pins
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Make sure that HST is on the wire(s) &lt;em>before&lt;/em> soldering! After the solder joint cools, slip the HST over the solder joint and apply heat until the joint is covered. Repeat this process for the remaining pins. There will be three &amp;lsquo;unused&amp;rsquo; pins that you can just ignore.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>
A few pins are not needed
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>

&lt;h3 id="printing">Printing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the electrical boxes there&amp;rsquo;s absolutely no room to spare, so all parts are designed to fit together with &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong> tight clearances. Print as slow as you need to in order too achieve very good dimensional accuracy. Like with the brass inserts, the various screw holes are intentionally undersized for better thread engagement.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;p>The HASP does run a bit warm, but not any warmer than other smart switches with similar form-factor. PLA will likely be fine unless you in tend to deploy the HASP in a particularly hot location.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="thermals">Thermals&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In testing, the parts of the HASP ran ~20º above ambient. Most of that heat comes from the small AC-&amp;gt;DC converter and the LCD. Surprisingly, the ESP8266 does not emit that much heat. Overall, nothing particularly alarming, especially when the HASP is deployed into a larger multi-gang electrical box with with plenty of air to radiate heat into. Apologies in advance for the mixed ºC/ºF units.&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
Less heat is radiated through the front of the HASP; the LCD backlight and embedded LEDs are clearly the warmest components
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tiny PNP transistor that toggles the LCD power is the hottest component, by far. Everything else has a relatively consistent temperature:&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="future-work">Future work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I did accomplish my two main goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Ambient light sensor for more responsive backlight control&lt;/li>
&lt;li>HomeSeer-like LEDs for additional information display&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>However, there&amp;rsquo;s a few aspects of the HASP that i&amp;rsquo;d like to further improve:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Increased automatic configuration w/ the HASP. There&amp;rsquo;s still a non-trivial amount of work required to set up a HASP with Home Assistant. The HASP device has many different attributes that could be exposed to Home Assistant automatically. E.G.: The HASP will periodically check for a firmware update; the HASP should configure Home Assistant with a &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/binary_sensor.mqtt/#configuration">&lt;code>binary_sensor&lt;/code>&lt;/a> that indicates if there&amp;rsquo;s a firmware update available.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Some of the automations that live in Home Assistant to manage button presses / update screen content could probably be re-factored down to a few generic scripts and services.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The display uses a &lt;a href="https://forum.digikey.com/t/resistive-touch-vs-capacitive-touch-whats-the-difference/1063">resistive matrix&lt;/a> to detect touch events. Resistive screens, while cheap, are a bit finnicky and inferior to the more consistent and precise capacitive touch screen tech. If Nextion ever makes a capacitive version of the NX3224T024, then it would be an instant upgrade!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Similarly, the viewing angle on the LCD is&amp;hellip; not great. The HASP, like most light switches, is at a convenient height for hands&amp;hellip; not eyes. If you&amp;rsquo;re standing relatively close to the HASP, you&amp;rsquo;ll be looking down at the screen with quite a steep angle. Depending on the current screen brightness and colors, this may result in a washed out and illegible screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Better LED diffusion. There&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of space for light pipes or similar, but I would like to find a better way of diffusing the LEDs. Or even to fit a masking layer between the LEDs and the plate, so the effect would be akin to a back-lit silhouette.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Effects for the LEDs. Right now, the LEDs only support on/off/brightness commands. Their ability to passively indicate information would be enhanced if Home Assistant could send &amp;lsquo;effect&amp;rsquo; commands, too. E.G.: Rather than HA having to send a constant stream of color/brightness commands to fade between blue, green, yellow, purple, simply send a &lt;code>fade(2s) blue, green, yellow, purple&lt;/code> command.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of spare room on the HASP PCB for the 10KΩ resistor. This would simplify the creation of the wiring harness. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to learn KiKad, this might be a very gentle way to start learning it. 🤔&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Enclose the LED tape 100% inside the HASP. This version works well and the small &amp;lsquo;hole&amp;rsquo; in the enclosure. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s any safety concern w/ the current design, but I&amp;rsquo;d still like to have the low voltage stuff 100% blocked off from thee electrical box&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Since then, my weather station has been dutifully collecting data that&amp;rsquo;s been invaluable for augmenting automation that deals with indoor climate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the numerous wild fires in California rage on, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2020/08/21/wildfire-smoke-blankets-the-west-as-california-records-worlds-worst-air-quality/">the air quality has gone from bad to dangerous&lt;/a>. Knowing that outside was warmer, but less humid, was no longer enough to make a smart decision about weather or not to open the windows for some cost-effective cooling. I now need HomeAssistant to be aware of how clean the outside air was before making the decision to pipe in outdoor air.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post covers two things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A small update to the existing WS3 -&amp;gt; ESPHome -&amp;gt; HomeAssistant bridge code to take advantage of the WS3s' support for the ubiquitous &lt;code>PMS5003T&lt;/code> sensor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A simple 3d-printable enclosure for deploying the particulate matter sensor outdoors&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When deployed, it looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
Excuse the awkward camera angle; sensor is deployed in an awkward to photograph location.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Please ignore the awkward camera angle as the sensor is deployed in a location where there&amp;rsquo;s not quite enough room for proper camera placement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And results in graphs that look like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
Smoke particles are between .4μm to .7μm in size... which explains the elevated red line relative to other particle sizes.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>A simplified copy of this post appears on &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4581351">thingiverse&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/39560-outdoor-enclosure-for-pms5003-particulate-matter-s">prusaprinters&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-enclosure">The enclosure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As of writing, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4044492">one existing enclosure&lt;/a> for the sensor on thingiverse. Unfortunately, the enclosure does not appear to have any design features for mounting to a pole nor does it have any bug-proofing design elements. I took this opportunity to design my own that could be easily mounted, features a slanted &amp;lsquo;roof&amp;rsquo; to prevent standing moisture ingress and could use standard size tobacco pipe filters to keep all but the tiniest of insects/particles out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sensor uses a small fan to draw ambient air past an infrared laser. As airborne particles cross the laser beam, they reflect a certain amount of light which can be correlated with the size of the particle. This data can then be turned into fairly accurate counts of how many particles of a given size are in the sampled air. The enclosure is a basic box with two circular air channels pointed downwards to prevent moisture ingress. The intake and exhaust ports are at staggered heights and pointed in opposite directions and to minimize the chance of recirculating the same air.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lower port is the intake which connects to a few small holes on the front of the sensor and the exhaust port is the raised port which connects directly to the exhaust fan. If you could remove the first few mm from the front, it would look something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/08/adding-an-airborne-particulate-mater-sensor-to-ws3-weather-station/images/f360_air_channels.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing labeled ingress/egress for air flow" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>From the side, you can see the two air channels and the few mm of room in the back for wiring. The sensor sits on a &amp;lsquo;pedestal&amp;rsquo; to keep it elevated away from any moisture that may collect on the bottom of the enclosure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The base plate/pedestal are secured to the &amp;lsquo;body&amp;rsquo; with two M3 screws. I used &lt;code>10mm&lt;/code> as that&amp;rsquo;s what I had on hand, but screws between 6-12mm should work as well. The holes are sized for a M3, but any similar sized screw will work. Use a lighter or similar to heat the screw as you drive it into the plastic to create your own threads if using a larger/longer screw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides the &amp;lsquo;pedestal&amp;rsquo; there are a few contact surfaces that hold on to the sensor with a friction fit. The &amp;lsquo;ceiling&amp;rsquo; is a few mm thick and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t permit much moisture ingress but an optional slanted roof component can be printed as an extra precaution.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/08/adding-an-airborne-particulate-mater-sensor-to-ws3-weather-station/images/f360_side_profile.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing side profile of assembly and the two ports" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
Upper and lower chambers for exhaust and intake.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>While designing the enclosure, I used this &lt;a href="https://grabcad.com/library/pms5003-2">&lt;code>PMS5003&lt;/code> model&lt;/a> from Leclercq Gregory. 🙏&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="printing">Printing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is a functional part with only three small surfaces that require reasonably tight precision to properly hold onto the sensor. The &lt;code>SPEED&lt;/code> setting with a &lt;code>.2mm&lt;/code> layer height and a reasonable 20% infill gave me part that works and feels water tight. The walls and ceiling need to keep water out so dipping below 15% infill or otherwise using settings that wont give solid layer adhesion is not advised. I printed using ABS for durability, but PLA will probably work if you can deploy into a shaded environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The shroud and the base are not optional, the triangle shaped block is intended to turn the flat roof of the shroud into a slanted roof so water can&amp;rsquo;t collect. It is optional but shown below.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>make a wire that can interface the PM2.5 sensor to the WS3 board via RJ11&lt;/li>
&lt;li>seal everything up&lt;/li>

Strongly suggested for outdoor deployments.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/91292A113/">2x M3 x 10mm screws&lt;/a> - Optional. The base can be glued to the shroud or any similar screw will work&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>: Where possible, I&amp;rsquo;ve used referral links. The links don&amp;rsquo;t raise the price of any item, they simply let the retailer know that I sent you and, in return, I get a small cut of your purchase. If you&amp;rsquo;re not comfortable with that, you can use a URL unwinding service to get the &amp;lsquo;raw&amp;rsquo; product link and drop the attribution/commission part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>General bits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Superglue&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waterproofing caulk/sealant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drill/Screwdriver&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Driver bit for the screws&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The stepped drill bit in the above picture is not a requirement if you assemble things in the correct oder. The cable egress hole is sized for a &amp;lsquo;typical&amp;rsquo; 3 pair &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_jack#RJ11,_RJ14,_RJ25_wiring">RJ11 cable&lt;/a> plus a tiny bit of wiggle room. I needed a working cable to test the code while the parts were printing so the hole in the printed base needed to be enlarged slightly to fit the head of the cable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wiring">Wiring&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no ready-made cable out there that&amp;rsquo;ll join the two devices so one must be made. Fortunately, there&amp;rsquo;s only 6 wires to deal with&amp;hellip; 4 of them are distinct.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sacrifice the cable that comes with the PM2.5 sensor and the RJ11 cable by cutting them in half and solder the correct wires together. The &lt;em>color&lt;/em> of the wires that come in both the RJ11 cable and the PM2.5 cable are likely going to differ from the ones I used so I&amp;rsquo;ve left those details out and provided a table showing which pins are to be joined together:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>With the wiring done, the sensor just needs to be stuffed into the enclosure. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to thread the RJ11 cable through the hole in the base plate &lt;em>BEFORE&lt;/em> soldering it to the cable for the PM2.5 sensor&amp;hellip; otherwise you&amp;rsquo;ll need that stepped drill bit! 🙃&lt;/p>

&lt;p>
Sensor has been press-fit into the enclosure and wire fed through the base plate.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>To finish, secure the base with screws and a bit of water-proofing caulk for good measure:&lt;/p>

I suggest waiting until the end to glue on the optional roof and waiting until just before that to glue on the optional mesh screens.

&lt;h2 id="the-code">The code&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Setting up and using ESPHome is outside the scope of this post but there are several &lt;a href="https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html">good guides&lt;/a> out there. Once you have that set up, &lt;a href="https://esphome.io/custom/custom_component.html">include&lt;/a> the &lt;code>ws3.h&lt;/code> file and set up your custom sensor as shown below. A working example and more detail is over on the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/kquinsland/ws3-to-esphome-bridge/">github repo&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;ll look like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I needed some horizontal / vertical cable rings for cat5 and power cables. I would have used the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3315960">1U Rackmount Cable Management Rings&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/boulwarek/about">boulwarek&lt;/a> except the hole spacing didn&amp;rsquo;t work for my application. I needed cable rings for the &amp;lsquo;front-to-back&amp;rsquo; braces which have distinct dimensions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>holes needed to be spaced &lt;code>10.85mm&lt;/code> apart&lt;/li>
&lt;li>distance between center of screw is &lt;code>20.0mm&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;figure >

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I made the rings slightly smaller as the horizontal / vertical runs I needed rings for do not carry more than a few cables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A similar copy of this post is on &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4546078">thingiverse&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/36851-server-rack-cable-org">prusaprinters&lt;/a> page.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="printing">Printing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Theses are &amp;lsquo;function&amp;rsquo; parts, so the cheapest material and fastest settings work. No support material needed and minimal bridging with the suggested print orientation shown below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While drafting this post, I discovered that there appears to be a newer version of the RD6006: the 6012. As far as I can tell, they&amp;rsquo;re in the same &amp;lsquo;family&amp;rsquo; and have the same dimensions so the CAD and related model files below &lt;em>should&lt;/em> work w/ the RD6012 just as they do w/ the 6006, but i can only &amp;lsquo;guarantee&amp;rsquo; that the CAD and related model files below will work with the &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/riden-rd6006/">RD6006&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A version of this post appears on &lt;a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/36338-poe-and-qc30-adapter-for-rd6006-psu">prusaprinters&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4536551">thingiverse&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what">What&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A small enclosure for a PoE injector and QC 3.0 charger designed to sit on top of the RD6012 PSU &amp;lsquo;kit&amp;rsquo; sold all over aliexpress and banggood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assembled, it looks like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The RD6006 is incredibly versatile, but can only supply power for about 85% of the devices that make their way onto my &amp;lsquo;healing&amp;rsquo; bench. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t keen on taking up more valuable space with a device dedicated to PoE injection so finding a way to mod one into the PSU seemed like a good idea. Similarly, adding a versatile USB port seemed like a no-brainer as my &lt;a href="http://www.miniware.com.cn/product/ts80-soldering-iron-more/">favorite soldering iron&lt;/a> is powered via QuickCharge 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three useful bench tools, one footprint, one consumed power outlet. What&amp;rsquo;s not to love?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="printing">Printing:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are two components for this build:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the &amp;lsquo;plate&amp;rsquo; which rests on the top of the PSU case and has small &amp;lsquo;fences&amp;rsquo; to fix the circuit boards in place. It&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;lsquo;salmon&amp;rsquo; colored component&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the &amp;lsquo;lid&amp;rsquo; is the (mostly) transparent yellow component which holds the auxiliary power supplies (pink components) in place and keeps all voltages away from people.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;figure >

&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I used black PETG, but any material and at least 10% infill should be fine. Tune the layer height to taste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;lsquo;plate&amp;rsquo; does not need any supports nor does the lid if printed in the suggested print orientation shown below 👇. I printed with settings optimized for speed so there was minimal sagging, but nothing substantial. What little there was didn&amp;rsquo;t interfere with clearance of any other internal component and was completely hidden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re not comfortable with bridging long distances, you can optionally enforce support material from the build plate to the top of the lid &lt;strong>or&lt;/strong> flip the lid upside down and use supports for the four feet where the screws go. Because any sagging would be hidden inside,&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="components">Components&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In addition to the miscellaneous wire and crimp connectors, there are two components used in this design:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33019891423.html">PoE injector&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y9HP4KM/">QC 3.0 Charger&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="assembly">Assembly&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t have any pictures from the assembly 😞, but it&amp;rsquo;s not particularly difficult to figure out from the attached pictures. In general, the steps to take are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="0">
&lt;li>Print everything and clean up the parts as needed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>de-shell the PoE injector and QC3 charger. A plastic pry-tool or a few flat-head screwdrivers will help here!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>desolder the existing mains connections from both modules and solder on new ones. The new ones don&amp;rsquo;t need to be long, just a bit longer than the leads that came on the module PCBs!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>disconnect power from the assembled PSU and remove the case cover&lt;/li>
&lt;li>place the &amp;lsquo;plate&amp;rsquo; onto the top of the PSU and use a pencil to mark all 5 holes on the cover&lt;/li>
&lt;li>remove the plate, drill out all 5 holes and use a file to smooth down any sharp edges on the big hole as that&amp;rsquo;s where the mains wires will go. A burr poking through insulation means the case may become energized @ mains voltages! 💥 💀&lt;/li>
&lt;li>crimp connectors onto wires and attach to the mains supply &lt;strong>after&lt;/strong> the switch and fuse!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>place the &amp;lsquo;plate&amp;rsquo; back onto the PSU cover&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run the wires through the new hole in the top of the PSU case and through the hole in the &amp;lsquo;plate&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add the PoE injector and QC3 module to the plate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>join the mains leads to the module leads. I used &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wago-221-413-LEVER-NUTS-Conductor-Connectors/dp/B06XGYXVXR/">Wago&lt;/a> connectors, but simple wirenuts or a screw terminal block will work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use M3 screws to secure the lid to the plate and the PSU. I intentionally drilled the holes slightly too small so the screws would thread against the case. Not ideal, but works absolutely fine for something that&amp;rsquo;s not load-bearing or going to be repeatedly re-screwed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>re-connect the IEC power connector and power on&lt;/li>
&lt;li>monitor for sounds and smells that indicate you screwed up. begin testing PoE and USB port for proper power.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Just prior to seating the &amp;lsquo;lid&amp;rsquo; you should have something like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="version-2">Version 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 2020-12-12:&lt;/strong> I outgrew version 1! I needed a few more ports and didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time&amp;hellip; so I just scaled the part up to double the number of jacks. The links below and the thingiverse and prusaprinters links have been updated w/ the new STL files. Printing and attachment works exactly the same as with the 1x8 version. Rather than include the Fusion360 source, I have included a standard STEP file.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
Yes, I do need to re-do the cable runs; they&amp;#39;re a mess
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="what">What&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Taking the side / rear of my rack off every time I needed to change which host(s) were connected to the monitor was starting to get old. Only recently did I realize that you can fit more than just RJ45 jacks in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_module">Keystone Jack&lt;/a>. A few measurements, a quick search through thingiverse and some CAD time later, this is the result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The model is tailored to my specific rack, but should be easily adoptable to any other dimensions. Import the Fusion360 model and then edit the first sketch in the timeline as needed and adjust the &lt;code>pattern on line&lt;/code> step to adjust the number of keystone jacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, you can always just glue the print to whichever surface you need it mounted on as there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of broad/flat surface for adhesive if the two built-in screw holes won&amp;rsquo;t work!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As is, the model has:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>8 jacks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>178.5mm&lt;/code> from &amp;lsquo;edge&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;edge&amp;rsquo; between the two screw holes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>6.5mm&lt;/code> diameter for the holes as my rack uses M6 screws.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Note: After printing the model you see in the pictures below, I added a small cutout which should make it easier to depress the clip on the &amp;lsquo;male&amp;rsquo; end of a keystone device from the &amp;lsquo;user facing&amp;rsquo; side as you&amp;rsquo;d typically find on a proper patch panel&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with how it turned out: 8 jacks is more than enough for current and (projected!) future use. The only obvious improvement would be moving the numbers from the bottom to the top where there&amp;rsquo;s more room. As it is now, the perimeters around the numbers look a bit weird as they merge w/ the bottom edge that are flush w/ the rack and the top edges that are flush w/ the jacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/belfers/about">&lt;code>belfers&lt;/code>&lt;/a> for the &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3150524">Keystone model&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The details are on the &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4536257">thingiverse&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/36325-8-port-keystone-patch-panel">prusaprinters&lt;/a> page.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="printing">Printing:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Any material and at least 10% infill should be fine.
No supports if you use the suggested print orientation shown in picture below.
Tolerances on the jacks are somewhat tight so printing at a more accurate setting is probably going to be a good idea.&lt;/p>

Jury is still out on weather or not the switch was worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cluster is a hodgepodge of second hand Intel NUCs and other scavenged compute hardware i&amp;rsquo;ve collected over the past few years. Some of it runs on 12v, some of it on 19v. For each node, there&amp;rsquo;s a dedicated switch mode power supply. Each supply takes up an outlet and brings a bit of cable mgmt related clutter. The solution is consolidation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So thats how this project came to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what">What&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A set of 3d printable parts to compactly combine two LRS-350 PSUs into a compact unit with optional voltage and current displays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The details are on the &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4504948">thingiverse&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/35514-dual-mean-well-lrs-350-psu">prusaprinters&lt;/a> page.&lt;/p>
