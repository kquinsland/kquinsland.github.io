&lt;p&gt;This is a quick project to create a wearable RFID fob that can be easily attached to a watch band.
The idea is to have a small RFID tag that can be used for various purposes, such as access control or identification that is - more or less - as convenient as a surgically implanted tag, but without the need for embedding anything in your body.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I made a thing: GPS/PPS clock source for ntpd</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/yet-another-gps-pps-opnsense/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/yet-another-gps-pps-opnsense/</guid><description>&lt;div class="details admonition tip open"&gt;

 &lt;div class="admonition-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just a &amp;lsquo;pointer&amp;rsquo; post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, I had a dedicated raspberry pi with a GPS module acting as the &lt;code&gt;ntp&lt;/code&gt; server for my home network. I chose to use a dedicated host for this because my router - at the time - did not have a serial port that I could leverage.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I made a thing: Yet another 3d printed speaker</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/3d-printed-subwoofer-and-arylic-amp-enclosure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/3d-printed-subwoofer-and-arylic-amp-enclosure/</guid><description>&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD002 --&gt;
&lt;h1 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story made &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; short: the amplifier inside my ancient 2.1 desktop speakers died and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything &amp;ldquo;off the shelf&amp;rdquo; that would serve as a suitable replacement &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; integrate well with Home Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you can&amp;rsquo;t buy it, you have to build it!
And as it turns out, there&amp;rsquo;s a whole community of audiophiles that have published designs on all the usual places you&amp;rsquo;d find free designs for makers.
Similarly, there&amp;rsquo;s a few companies that seems to specialize in audio electronics aimed &lt;em&gt;specifically at&lt;/em&gt; people that are building their own speaker systems and just want someone else to handle the electronics and software.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Home Assistant Switch Plate (HASP)</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/enhanced-homeassistantswitchplate/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/enhanced-homeassistantswitchplate/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;HASwitchPlate&lt;/a&gt; project by &lt;code&gt;aderusha&lt;/code&gt; is brilliant. He&amp;rsquo;s managed to arrange some relatively cheap commodity hardware into a package that conveniently fits into a prime location for interacting with Home Automation - the light switch. The entire package sips power off of the already present mains wiring and connects to any MQTT broker via the esp8266 chip. As the HASP was designed to be used with Home Assistant, the humble 2.4 inch LCD transforms into an accessible control surface for an incredibly powerful home automation platform!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Adding an airborne particulate mater sensor to WS3 Weather Station</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/ws3-weather-station-pm25-sensor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/ws3-weather-station-pm25-sensor/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A while back, I &lt;a href="https://github.com/kquinsland/ws3-to-esphome-bridge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;posted a small bit of code&lt;/a&gt; that could decode the data from the ubiquitous WS3 Weather Station and make it accessible to the amazing &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;HomeAssistant&lt;/a&gt; via the wonderful &lt;a href="https://esphome.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;ESPHome&lt;/a&gt; project. Since then, my weather station has been dutifully collecting data that&amp;rsquo;s been invaluable for augmenting automation that deals with indoor climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the numerous wild fires in California rage on, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2020/08/21/wildfire-smoke-blankets-the-west-as-california-records-worlds-worst-air-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;the air quality has gone from bad to dangerous&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that outside was warmer, but less humid, was no longer enough to make a smart decision about weather or not to open the windows for some cost-effective cooling. I now need HomeAssistant to be aware of how clean the outside air was before making the decision to pipe in outdoor air.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>home lab: simple printable cable org</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/home-lab-simple-printable-cable-org/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/home-lab-simple-printable-cable-org/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Quick / another &amp;ldquo;i made a thing!&amp;rdquo; post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed some horizontal / vertical cable rings for cat5 and power cables. I would have used the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3315960" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;1U Rackmount Cable Management Rings&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/boulwarek/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;boulwarek&lt;/a&gt; except the hole spacing didn&amp;rsquo;t work for my application. I needed cable rings for the &amp;lsquo;front-to-back&amp;rsquo; braces which have distinct dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>electronics lab: enhanced psu</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/electronics-lab-enhanced-bench-psu/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/electronics-lab-enhanced-bench-psu/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While doing the PoE related testing for &lt;a href="https://karlquinsland.com/poe-at-a-distance-ruined-my-cat5-speeds/" rel=""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; incident, it occurred to me that I never got around to sharing the files for a small modification to the popular RD6006 PSU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While drafting this post, I discovered that there appears to be a newer version of the RD6006: the 6012. As far as I can tell, they&amp;rsquo;re in the same &amp;lsquo;family&amp;rsquo; and have the same dimensions so the CAD and related model files below &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work w/ the RD6012 just as they do w/ the 6006, but i can only &amp;lsquo;guarantee&amp;rsquo; that the CAD and related model files below will work with the &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/riden-rd6006/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;RD6006&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>home lab: mini 'universal' patch panel</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/home-lab-keystone-bracket/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/home-lab-keystone-bracket/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is another brief &amp;ldquo;i made a thing!&amp;rdquo; posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="version-2"&gt;Version 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2020-12-12:&lt;/strong&gt; I outgrew version 1! I needed a few more ports and didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time&amp;hellip; so I just scaled the part up to double the number of jacks. The links below and the thingiverse and prusaprinters links have been updated w/ the new STL files. Printing and attachment works exactly the same as with the 1x8 version. Rather than include the Fusion360 source, I have included a standard STEP file.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>home lab: consolidating multiple PSUs</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/home-lab-consolidated-psu/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/home-lab-consolidated-psu/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A while back, I traded writing salt states and managing systemd &lt;code&gt;.service&lt;/code&gt; files wrapping &lt;code&gt;podman&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvEwPLcLcA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;&amp;lsquo;simplicity&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; of running kubernetes in my home lab. Jury is still out on weather or not the switch was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cluster is a hodgepodge of second hand Intel NUCs and other scavenged compute hardware i&amp;rsquo;ve collected over the past few years. Some of it runs on 12v, some of it on 19v. For each node, there&amp;rsquo;s a dedicated switch mode power supply. Each supply takes up an outlet and brings a bit of cable mgmt related clutter. The solution is consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
