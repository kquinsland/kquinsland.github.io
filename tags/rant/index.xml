<p>I was looking for a way to incorporate some of the <em>many</em> cheap / industrial grade sensors from AliExpress with Home Assistant.
Long story short: almost everything electronic in the industrial space uses <a href="https://modbus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Modbus</a> to communicate, typically with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">PLC</a>. While Home Assistant <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/modbus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">does have support</a> for the Modbus protocol, but wanted to use a PLC that could manage the sensors directly and expose the values over the network in a more standard format; MQTT.</p>
<p>Turns out, quite a few PLCs come with network interfaces and can speak MQTT now!</p>
<p>So I picked up a <a href="https://www.rievtech.com/PR-18DC-DAI-R-N-pd72286477.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"><code>PR-18DC-DAI-R-N</code></a> PLC from the &lsquo;budget friendly&rsquo; supplier rievtech. The PLC was put into service in 2018 and never updated; the firmware version it was running was almost certainly below <code>150</code> but I didn&rsquo;t record the specific version.</p>
<figure >

<p>Hoping to squash a small bug, I chose to upgrade the firmware to version <code>152</code> which was released at the end of 2020 and somehow managed to brick the device 🤦.</p>
<p>I am <em>speculating</em> but it looks like something significant changed around firmware version <code>150</code>. If you try to update a device from a version prior to <code>150</code> - like I did - something in memory is not properly migrated to the format required by versions after <code>150</code> and this causes the update process to fail before completion:</p>
<figure >

            SO close!
            
                
                
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>That failure message came from the <a href="https://www.rievtech.com/phoenix/admin/download?fileId=jGUKpAvYWcQE&amp;dp=GvUApKfKKUAU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Update_Net_V152_20201205.zip</a> file which is meant for the ethernet equipped PLCs in the <code>PR</code> line. The failure apparently soft bricks the PLC.</p>
<figure >

<p>The PLC seemed &lsquo;alive&rsquo; as I could still see <code>arp</code> packets coming from it&rsquo;s ethernet port on boot and the web server seemed to accept my connection but never return any data. Even after restarting the PLC, the firmware updater was able to open a new connection and flash the firmware&hellip; always failing at the same spot: 99.17%.</p>
<p>Clearly <em>something</em> is alive and well inside the PLC&hellip; If I can connect to whatever <em>is</em> running and convince that process to update the flash then I have a good shot to do &lsquo;solderless&rsquo; recovery. Absolute worst case, I buy another one and clone the flash memory from the working one onto the bricked one.</p>
<h2 id="recovery-process">Recovery process</h2>
<p>Turns out, their support team has a file ready to go for this exact problem! I guess I&rsquo;m not the first person. Really wish they&rsquo;d publish this file and/or procedure on their website. I could have recovered from my failure in minutes with a quick google search and saved myself a few hours of trouble shooting before drafting a support ticket&hellip; not to mention the days of waiting for a reply. Oh well. That&rsquo;s why <em>I&rsquo;m</em> documenting it.</p>
<p>I was given a 2.6MB file named <code>UpdateFail_PR-18DC-DAI-R-N_V150.zip</code>. After extracting, it looks a lot like their <em>regular</em> firmware update archives, just much smaller. I suspect that the archive is much smaller because it&rsquo;s only got flash images for a few affected models/devices. In any event, the archive comes with a <code>doc</code> file that I couldn&rsquo;t open and was able to eventually convert it to a <code>pdf</code> which is also attached to this post.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the PLC using their <a href="https://www.rievtech.com/USB-Cable-pd67130.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">programming cable</a></li>
<li>Open the COM port and &lsquo;prepare&rsquo; the device. This takes only a few seconds</li>
<li>Click the update button. In my case, I got a failure telling me to `Please power off the PLC first, and then power on again!&quot;</li>
<li>Power cycle the PLC, keeping the update program and COM port open</li>
<li>Click <code>Start</code>. The process of flashing version <code>150</code> started and took several minutes to finish</li>
</ul>
<p>This left me with a <em>completely working</em> PLC 🥳! I was able to access the web interface and use the LCD screen. I was <em>then</em> able to use the network update tool to the firmware version released recently; version <code>152</code>.</p>
<p>So there you go. If a failed network update leaves your <code>PR</code> series PLC in a mostly-not-working state, there is hope!</p>

Skip to <a href="#tldr" rel="">TL;DR</a> for a working Home Assistant config.</p>
<p>Briefly, <a href="https://www.onvif.org/profiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">ONVIF</a> is an industry group that maintains a set of standards to allow for interoperability between IP Cameras and related devices from multiple vendors. One set of protocols so your cameras from <code>$vendorA</code> will work with with the recording/analytics software from <code>$vendorB</code> which can then pipe events into software from <code>$vendorC</code>.
How ONVIF works and how it&rsquo;s implemented are beyond the scope of this rant, but, like most standards that haven&rsquo;t aged well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">SOAP</a> is involved. 🤮.</p>
<p>The IP Camera in question is the <code>Amcrest IP4M-1051</code>, though it does appear that other devices from Amcrest are effected by some of the same issues I&rsquo;ll detail below.
Additionally, Amcrest appears to be a budget brand offering cheaper versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahua_Technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">DaHua</a> hardware, so the firmware Amcrest uses likely originates from DaHua.</p>
<p>The hardware is pretty good for the price. About $80 and you get a camera with a pretty wide field of view, 4K resolution, automatic IR leds/filter, PTZ servos, 10/100 Ethernet <em>and</em> 2.4/5ghz WiFi. The software, however is scarry 😱.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only spent a few hours with the camera so far, but here&rsquo;s an incomplete list of the security-related issues i&rsquo;ve noticed in that time:</p>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s no way to require the web interface be served over HTTPS. You can turn on HTTPS support, but you can&rsquo;t turn of HTTP support!</li>
<li>ONVIF runs over HTTP &hellip; on port 80!</li>
<li>Only the ADMIN user is supported for ONVIF</li>
<li>Passwords are limited to 32 characters in length&hellip; but the web UI won&rsquo;t inform you about this.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="firmware">Firmware</h3>
<p>Before anybody asks, yes, I did update the firmware to the latest version immediately after unboxing.
As of writing, the latest firmware available is version <code>V2.620.00AC000.3.R.20191218</code> which can be downloaded <a href="https://sup-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Firmware/IP4M-1051/Amcrest_IPC-AWXX-V2-Rhea_Eng_NP_AMCREST_V2.620.00AC000.3.R.20191218.bin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>.</p>

<p>I suspect that the next issue might have something to do with the &lsquo;always on&rsquo; HTTP server&hellip; 🤔</p>
<h2 id="onvif-over-port-80">ONVIF over port 80</h2>
<p>The inciting &lsquo;incident&rsquo; for this post was a &lsquo;generic&rsquo; error from Home Assistant while trying to connect the camera to HA.
While going through the config flow, I&rsquo;d get a super useful <code>an unknown error occurred</code> message 🙃.</p>
<p>After a bit of digging through verbose HA logs, I started to suspect that the default port of <code>5000</code> was not the correct port despite the port being &lsquo;open&rsquo; on the camera:</p>

</div><p>Sure enough, Home Assistant found a responsive ONVIF endpoint on port 80. Repeated testing showed that port 80 is the ONLY port with a responsive ONVIF endpoint 🤦.</p>
<p>So yeah. ONVIF traffic, just like the web UI traffic, can be sniffed by anybody between the client and the camera. That&rsquo;s not OK for a device that&rsquo;s intended to be used for security.</p>
<p>So this little setting is basically useless:</p>

<p>After discovering that ONVIF only &lsquo;works&rsquo; over port 80, I took a moment to get over my disappointment and then tried to set up a second user with minimal authority on the camera; read only and limited permission to move the camera around.</p>
<p>Except I was never able to get HA to successfully connect to the camera when using the secondary user. Home Assistant still failed to connect to the camera over ONVIF even after elevating the secondary user to the privilege level of an admin:</p>

<p>As Home Assistant really does not expose a ton of debugging information, I tried the secondary user credentials with the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.biyee.onvifer&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"><code>Onvifer</code></a> app. The debugging logs from that app confirmed that only the <code>admin</code> credential set &lsquo;worked&rsquo; with ONVIF.</p>
<p>After a bit more research, it turns out that I&rsquo;m not the first person to discover this:</p>

<p>Now i&rsquo;m embarrassed that it took me so long to discover an issue that&rsquo;s been documented since AT LEAST summer of 2019! 😳</p>
<h3 id="password-length">Password length</h3>
<p>Can we <em>please</em> <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/33470/what-technical-reasons-are-there-to-have-low-maximum-password-lengths" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">stop putting ceilings on password length</a>?</p>
<p>Or, at least if you&rsquo;re going to set an upper bound on password length, please make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re consistent about enforcing the length</li>
<li>You tell the user when their password is longer than allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The very first time the default credentials are used to sign into the camera, you&rsquo;re prompted to change the default password. Good! Only problem: the password generated by my password was, apparently, longer than the camera supports. The new admin password was <em><strong>silently</strong> truncated</em> as I was logged in.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that the password stored in the manager wouldn&rsquo;t let me in until after the camera applied it&rsquo;s FW update and rebooted. After a factory reset, I figured out what happened.</p>
<p>The <code>maxlength</code> property of the login form differs from the password set form. In any case, there&rsquo;s no warning that the input exceeds the length!</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost 2021, but we still have IP Cameras shipping with 2011&rsquo;s security issues. <strong>Absolutely</strong> do not expose your IP Cameras directly to the internet or otherwise allow them to contact the internet. Keep cameras on their <em>own</em> dedicated and isolated network and consider the admin credentials for the camera to be compromised. Seriously re-consider using WiFi for your cameras.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to use the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/onvif/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Home Assistant ONVIF integration</a> to control an <code>Amcrest IP4M-1051</code>, you must use the <code>admin</code> credentials and change the port from <code>5000</code> to <code>80</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first bit of documentation you see when unboxing the camera is this little guy:</p>

            This is *literally* the first thing you see when unpacking the camera.
