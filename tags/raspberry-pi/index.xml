&lt;p&gt;I have been experimenting with the concept of a Home Assistant powered &lt;a href="https://www.qsrautomations.com/blog/kitchen-automation/what-is-a-kds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;KDS&lt;/a&gt; for a few years now and have found that the refrigerator happens to be an especially good place to surface some information and device controls.&lt;/p&gt;

 Yes, it&amp;#39;s over-exposed and shot at an awkward angle but that&amp;#39;s what it took to minimize glare!

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with a few different ways to surface various home automation controls in the appropriate place and at a good time. One prototype host is deployed behind a small LCD under some cabinets in a high traffic area. This host is a raspberry pi 4 with a &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/poe-hat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;PoE hat&lt;/a&gt;. It boots a very stripped down version of &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;Raspberry Pi OS&lt;/a&gt; into a web browser running in Kiosk mode.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
