&lt;h1 id="frigate-kubernetes-edition"&gt;Frigate: Kubernetes edition&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a follow up to my &lt;a href="https://karlquinsland.com/frigate-install/" rel=""&gt;&amp;lsquo;Frigate From Scratch&amp;rsquo; post&lt;/a&gt;.
Most of that post is still relevant today but I have since moved almost all of my workloads into Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is intended to document some of the issues I hit while trying to get Frigate running in my k8s cluster.
This is not every issue I hit, just the ones that are not directly related to my specific environment/setup/workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Arris SB8200 Prometheus Exporter</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/arris-sb8200-prometheus-exporter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/arris-sb8200-prometheus-exporter/</guid><description>&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD002 --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very short &amp;ldquo;announcement&amp;rdquo; post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To beef up my home-lab observability stack, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a few projects to expose more data to Prometheus.
Getting metrics from my cable modem has been on the &amp;ldquo;todo&amp;rdquo; list for literally years.
There have been various metric exporters written in the past but they have either been archived/deleted off of GitHub or are otherwise inappropriate for my needs.
So, I wrote my own.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
