Record breaking temperatures results in a distribution grid stressed beyond it&amp;rsquo;s abilities which guarantees blackouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Independent_System_Operator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;organization that oversees the electric grid&lt;/a&gt; in California publishes RSS feeds for various types of grid related news and events. All the CA ISO RSS feeds are published &lt;a href="http://www.caiso.com/Pages/GlobalRSS.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but the two feed that I&amp;rsquo;m using are:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Announcing The Missing ToDoist Tools</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/the-missing-todoist-tools/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/the-missing-todoist-tools/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="tmtdt-the-missing-todoist-tools-"&gt;TMTDT: The Missing ToDoist Tools 🎉&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, TMTDT started as a small collection of scripts that I used to augment ToDoist with features they can&amp;rsquo;t/won&amp;rsquo;t implement. It&amp;rsquo;s grown quite a bit since then.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those scripts started as simple idea and quickly morphed into a creaky, but essential, tool. As more features were added it continued too morph into an unmaintainable mess. Untangling that mess was on my todo list but never a high priority partly because of issues TMTDT was designed to solve 🤦.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
