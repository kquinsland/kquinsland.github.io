&lt;p&gt;My beloved coffee maker of 10 years has finally died 😢.
Parts are no longer available from either the manufacturer or the second-hand market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of a (slight) holiday sale discount, I pulled the trigger on a coffee maker that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://us.moccamaster.com/pages/sustainability-at-our-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;designed to be repairable forever&lt;/a&gt;.
The perpetual serviceability is a side effect of an ultra-simple design; this coffee maker has &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; intelligent features which means there&amp;rsquo;s next to no remote control or customizability.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Teardown and Home Assistant integration with two generic Chinese 'smart' power strips.</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/esphome-power-strips/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/esphome-power-strips/</guid><description>&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD002 --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the Sonoff-S31 smart plugs.
They&amp;rsquo;re cheap, well made and - most importantly - trivial to flash with ESPHome and integrate into Home Assistant.
They do have one obvious draw back, though; optimized for a &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; US style outlet.
When you try to deploy them to a power strip, you end up loosing about 50% of the outlets on the strip!&lt;/p&gt;
