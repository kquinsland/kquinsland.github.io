<p>Curiosity got the better of me while putting together a BOM for a project and I decided to add one of the new Shelly devices to my order to bump the total over the threshold for a nice discount.</p>
<p>I have not seen a ton of discussion about what&rsquo;s inside of a any of the new Shelly Pro devices.
These &rsquo;next generation&rsquo; devices appear to all use a <a href="https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/gen2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">common and more <em>uniform</em> API</a> which, apparently, is too demanding of the ESP8266 based hardware so it won&rsquo;t be backported.</p>
<p>A cursory google only reveals some light technical details from a <a href="https://www.shelly-support.eu/forum/index.php?thread/10795-shelly-pro-4pm-teardown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">teardown post on a german site</a>. All of the pictures attached ot that post require a login üôÅ.</p>
<p>So here is <em>my</em> teardown. No login required!</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="what">What</h1>
<p>The Shelly Pro 4 PM is a rather compact DIN mounted relay/power monitoring module with some connectivity. The <code>4</code> is for the number of channels that can be independently switches and monitored.</p>

<p>As for connectivity, the <a href="https://shelly.cloud/knowledge-base/devices/shelly-pro-4pm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">official product page</a> sums it up nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professional 4 channels relay with Wi-Fi, LAN, and Bluetooth connection, suitable for home and facility automation with remote control and precise power management. DIN rail mountable inside a breaker box. Enhanced safety features and compatible with most used home automation platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="teardown">Teardown</h2>
<p>This Shelly 4PM feels like a step backwards in terms of build quality. The prior generation of devices were very dense little pucks and this feels pretty hollow; the plastic DIN case creaks and squeaks.</p>
<p>The internal layout isn&rsquo;t my favorite and it made both disassembly and reassembly a bit tenuous at a few points.
The layout may be inevitable, though, as DIN case is more or less a standard shape and size.
Layouts are almost always a bit weird when the electronics have to be designed to fit the case rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>Other than the layout quirks, the Shelly team continues to go with what they know: the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">espressif</a> line of chips. This time the ESP826x series is out and the much more capable ESP32 series is in&hellip; which allows for both the color LCD and the ethernet interface.</p>
<p>As is common with these types of devices, the ESP runs the show&hellip; but it has a few deputies: dedicated power monitoring ICs and an ethernet PHY.</p>
<p>And with that, let&rsquo;s get into it:</p>
<p>The main body of the shelly is clipped to the rear &lsquo;plate&rsquo; which houses the DIN rail attachment mechanism. You can see the clips on the very top and bottom along the left edge:</p>
<figure >

        40A at 240V is a _lot_ of power to fit into a fairly compact device!
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Viewed from the rear, the clips are easier to see in the four corners:</p>

<p>The rear plate lifts off to reveal the largest PCB. There are 4 copies of the same circuit. Very nice to see big traces with extra solder and some beefy current shunts!</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>

</figure>


<p>Just behind the &lsquo;input trigger&rsquo; terminals on the main PCB is a <code>2x10 @ 2.54mm pitch</code> female header. Into which slides the &lsquo;smarts&rsquo; PCB which hosts the main ESP32 MCU as well as the ethernet jack.</p>
<p>On this smaller PCB and next to the ethernet jack is a very small <code>1x6 @ 1mm pitch</code> female header block. It is cleverly hidden next to the jack but could probably be accessed with the case on if you&rsquo;re careful.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, this is a debug/programming header for at least the main MCU.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not pictured until later, but there is a <code>2x2 @ 2.54mm pitch</code> male header block on the other side of the smarts PCB. This is where a small daughterboard containing only the 3 buttons connects.</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>
        
        <p>
        How much do you want to bet that the pins on the debug header are the usual &#43;3.3, GND, IO0, RX, TX for ESP flashing?

<p>On the main PCB, behind the &lsquo;smarts&rsquo; PCB is a set of two ICs marked with <code>ADE7953ACPZ</code>. As expected, these are <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/analog-devices-inc/ADE7953ACPZ/2700176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">the energy management / monitoring ICs</a>.</p>
<p>Why two crystals, though?</p>
<p>The IC marked <code>MCP23S17</code> is a simple SPI based IO expander&hellip; almost certainly used to drive the relays and possibly command the power management ICs.</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>

<p>On the rear of the &lsquo;smarts&rsquo; PCB is the star of the show: <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Espressif-Systems/ESP32-D0WDQ6?qs=chTDxNqvsykWgzfXx0gR%252BQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">ESP32-D0WDQ6</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the passives and the flat flex socket for the LCD, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>cFeon QH64-104HIP 64 Megabit flash chip</li>
<li>SMSC8720A: 10/100 Megabit ethernet PHY</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also <em>another</em> daughterboard covered in kapton tape. This is soldered to the main PCB and just has a few electrolytic caps. I guess this arrangement was easier than trying to clear some room on the back of the main PCB so the heavy current traces could be kept simple ü§î?</p>
<p>In the top right corner you can see the 4 pin header where the button daughter board attaches&hellip; just next to the ethernet phy.</p>
<figure >

<p>From this angle, still in the top right corner, you can see the button daughter board attached to the 4 pin header.</p>
<figure >

    
        
    

    

    <figcaption>
        
        <p>
        Just a few very tiny passives!

<p>Electrically, nothing unusual or bizarre. Layout was a bit &lsquo;inventive&rsquo; but the unusual but standard shape of the case probably drove at least some of the decision to have 4 different PCBs that all have to be tediously connected by hand during manufacture!</p>
<p>Thats all for this one!</p>
