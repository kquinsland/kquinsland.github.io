# #TwoMinuteTeardown: Wozniak WPX-0001 Qi Tester

# Qi wireless power tester

The [Qi standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(standard)) for transmitting power is ~ 15 years old and has been ubiquitous for at least a decade now.
And yet, I have only _recently_ seen any testing equipment for it.

The [Wozniak WPX-0001A](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808097182455.html) is a simple tester that can measure the output level and protocol of Qi chargers.

In the box you get a basic NTC probe, a USB-C cable and the tester itself.
The printed paper "manual" is just a QR code that points to [`user.ee-lab.cn`](https://user.ee-lab.cn).

The unit is made up of two circular PCBs screwed together.
The screws are hiding behind the decal face plate.

Take your time here and use a heat gun to soften the adhesive... or you risk breaking the plastic cover.

The LCD is also glued in place. The ribbon cable is _just_ long enough; putting it back together is a bit of a pain.

The non-covered gold-plated traces and black silkscreen _pop_.
Unfortunately, most ICs are either too small for me to read or the marking have been laser etched off.

The business-end of the tester is a Qi receiver coil.
It's two coils of magnet wire and some magnets. Nothing special here.
