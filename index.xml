      <description>A while back, I traded writing salt states and managing systemd .service files wrapping podman for the &amp;lsquo;simplicity&amp;rsquo; of running kubernetes in my home lab. Jury is still out on weather or not the switch was worth it.
The cluster is a hodgepodge of second hand Intel NUCs and other scavenged compute hardware i&amp;rsquo;ve collected over the past few years. Some of it runs on 12v, some of it on 19v.</description>
