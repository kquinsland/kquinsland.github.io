This does not need to be another post espousing it&amp;rsquo;s many awesome qualities, so just trust me on this; Tasmota is AWESOME.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tasmota supports user configurable &lt;a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Rules/">rules&lt;/a> which are simple commands wired into various device triggers.
In short; a device running Tasmota gains some autonomy to react to events without needing to report the event to, and wait for commands from, a remote server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find the rules syntax to be a bit awkward and the list of practical examples feels like autodoc with a few practical examples sprinkled in.
I have &lt;em>never&lt;/em> been able to craft a Tasmota rule without also consulting the list of &lt;a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/">commands&lt;/a>
and doing a few searches through the github issues looking for issues/questions similar to mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is a simple &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s how i did it&amp;rdquo; that I wish I had found when I needed to solve the problem.
Hopefully this will save you some trouble!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mr-coffee">Mr. Coffee&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A $15 &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Sonoff-Pow/">smart relay&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo; is all that&amp;rsquo;s needed to turn a simple drip-over coffee maker into a remote-controllable coffee maker.
Immediately, you gain the ability to start brewing coffee in the morning from bed.
With a little extra integration work, start brewing coffee 10 minutes before your alarm is scheduled to go off. Simple quality of life improvement!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every coffee maker has at least one safety interlock to disable the heating element if it gets too hot, but some have additional interlocks. Specifically,
my coffee maker has two more interlocks in series with the heating element; if the carafe is removed or the water tank is empty, the circuit is broken and
the heater immediately stops producing heat. From the perspective of the smart relay, the power consumption is either 0 Watts or a bit over 1100 Watts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was not comfortable using Home Assistant to monitor power consumption and then toggle the relay off after observing an interlock kick in.
If something happened to the WiFi connection or the MQTT server or Home Assistant, there&amp;rsquo;s no way to disconnect power from the coffee maker; the relay will stay &amp;lsquo;on&amp;rsquo;.
If the interlock failed, somehow, the heating element would immediately begin pumping out heat when it &lt;em>really&lt;/em> shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing a simple &amp;ldquo;if power consumption drops below 1100 Watts, turn relay off&amp;rdquo; rule would be enough, except there&amp;rsquo;s no way to distinguish between the thermal interlock tripping
and the carafe being removed for a quick pour. The simple rule is incompatible with the extra interlocks; it will prematurely send the brewing 100% of the time the carafe is removed.
If you want to pour a cup of coffee while it&amp;rsquo;s still brewing, this is rather inconvenient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Solution: give the user 30 seconds to return the carafe during brewing before turning the relay off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the perspective of the outlet, ignore any lulls in power consumption as long as they&amp;rsquo;re shorter than 30 seconds. Otherwise, assume that an interlock &lt;em>has&lt;/em> tripped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is implemented with two rules:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">Rule1
# When relay1 (heater) is turned on, activate rule2
ON Power1#state=1 DO Rule2 1 ENDON
# and deactivate rule2 when the heater is turned off
ON Power1#state=0 DO Rule2 0 ENDON
# When Timer1 expires, turn the heater off
ON Rules#Timer=1 DO Power1 off ENDON
# When the current used by the heating element rises above 1 Amp, disable Timer1
ON Energy#Current&amp;gt;1 DO RuleTimer1 0 ENDON
# ... and enable rule 2
ON Energy#Current&amp;gt;1 DO Rule2 1 ENDON
Rule2
# Wait for power use to drop to 0; start counting down
ON Energy#Current&amp;lt;.2 DO RuleTimer1 30 ENDON
# and disable rule2 so the timer is not constantly reset
ON Energy#Current&amp;lt;.2 DO Rule2 0 ENDON
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I chose &lt;code>.2&lt;/code> Amps as the trigger, but the logic works the exact same way with Power / Wattage.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="electric-kettle">Electric Kettle&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I wanted to detect when my electric kettle was done boiling the water so I could play a sound and flash the lights in whichever room I happened to be in at the time.
This is trivial to do with a &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Sonoff-S31/">smart outlet&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo; and a &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/binary_sensor.template/">template sensor&lt;/a> in Home Assistant:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">- &lt;span style="font-weight:bold">platform&lt;/span>: template
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">sensors&lt;/span>:
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">kettle_running&lt;/span>:
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">friendly_name&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="font-style:italic">&amp;#34;Kettle Boiling&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="font-style:italic"># If the kettle is using more than 5w, assume its on / boiling water&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">icon_template&lt;/span>: &amp;gt;-&lt;span style="font-style:italic">
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-style:italic"> {% if states(&amp;#39;sensor.kettle_energy_power&amp;#39;) | float &amp;gt; 5 %}
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-style:italic"> mdi:kettle-steam
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-style:italic"> {% else %}
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-style:italic"> mdi:kettle
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-style:italic"> {% endif %}&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">value_template&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="font-style:italic">&amp;#34;{{states(&amp;#39;sensor.kettle_energy_power&amp;#39;) | float &amp;gt; 5}}&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Only problem, Tasmota only publishes the kettle&amp;rsquo;s power once every 300 seconds. This means &lt;code>sensor.kettle_energy_power&lt;/code> only gets updated every 300s which makes it really hard
to fire off a &lt;em>timely&lt;/em> notification when the kettle is done.
The &amp;lsquo;brute-force&amp;rsquo; solution is to configure Tasmota to transmit the telemetry &lt;a href="https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/2567">continuously&lt;/a>.
Except there&amp;rsquo;s no need for the Tasmota device on the kettle to be constantly informing Home Assistant that there&amp;rsquo;s no power being used whenever the kettle is not on; my application only cares about the &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_edge">falling edge&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Borrow the trigger from the &lt;a href="#mr-coffee">Mr. Coffee&lt;/a> rule and shorten the &lt;a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/#teleperiod">telemetry period&lt;/a> only when the kettle
is consuming more than 1 Watt. Like the coffee maker, it&amp;rsquo;s either consuming 0 Watts or about 1.1 Kilowatt.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">Rule1
on ENERGY#Power&amp;gt;1 do Backlog TelePeriod 10; Rule2 1 endon
Rule2
on ENERGY#Power=0 do Backlog TelePeriod 1; Rule2 0 endon
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>As soon as the kettle starts using more than 1 Watt, configure Tasmota to publish its sensor data every 10 seconds.
I&amp;rsquo;ll get notified that the water is boiling within 10s; much better than 300s!
Once the power consumption goes back down to 0, reset the telemetry update period and disable the rule.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second rule must be disabled to prevent constant triggering of the rule when the kettle is not boiling.
Without the &lt;code>Rule2 0&lt;/code>, the console/logs for the device would be full of statements like this repeating every few seconds:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">RUL: ENERGY#POWER&amp;gt;1 performs &amp;#34;TelePeriod 10&amp;#34;
MQT: stat/tasmota_kettle/RESULT = {&amp;#34;TelePeriod&amp;#34;:10}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Hope that helped!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enhanced Home Assistant Switch Plate (HASP)</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/">HASwitchPlate&lt;/a> project by &lt;code>aderusha&lt;/code> is brilliant. He&amp;rsquo;s managed to arrange some relatively cheap commodity hardware into a package that conveniently fits into a prime location for interacting with Home Automation - the light switch. The entire package sips power off of the already present mains wiring and connects to any MQTT broker via the esp8266 chip. As the HASP was designed to be used with Home Assistant, the humble 2.4 inch LCD transforms into an accessible control surface for an incredibly powerful home automation platform!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within moments of discovering the project and browsing through a few examples, my mind ran wild with possibilities. After double checking the relatively low &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate#bill-of-materials">B.O.M.&lt;/a> cost,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While shopping for the parts to make my own version, I got a few ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/installed.jpg" alt="Picture showing modified HASP installed, LCD indicated the colors of the LEDs" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
If the LEDs weren&amp;#39;t on, you&amp;#39;d never know they were there 😊
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="modifications">Modifications&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, a brief word about indemnification:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>All instructions and information on this page is purely for informational purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original HASP and my modifications come with neither an expressed or implied warranty. By constructing your own, you assume all risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="software">Software&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The few software modifications I&amp;rsquo;ve made to the HASP project are relatively small and don&amp;rsquo;t implement anything significant or new; they are &amp;lsquo;quality of life&amp;rsquo; improvements that target small portions of the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I strongly believe that the hardest part of using a given piece automation technology should be taking it out of the box. To wit, Home Assistant has robust - &lt;a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/ability-to-set-entity-icon-through-mqtt-discovery/224538">but not perfect&lt;/a> - support for &lt;a href="Https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/">automatic device discovery and configuration via MQTT&lt;/a>. Once a device has connected to the MQTT broker, it simply publishes a document detailing how HA should interface with the device. It&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful experience to see a new device connect to the network for the first time and just a few seconds later the new device is registered in HA, waiting for you to start integrating it into automations 🤩🤤.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While there are quite a few sensors/stateful-attributes in the original HASP code, none of them automatically present themselves to Home Assistant 😔. I set about fixing that to the best of my abilities. Unfortunately, the LCD backlight is the only peripheral that could be &amp;lsquo;upgraded&amp;rsquo; to automatic configuration without making a ton of changes to the original code base.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of the hardware modifications detailed below automatically configure themselves with Home Assistant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original HASP code base uses allocates too little memory for storing MQTT credentials. Any username or password longer than 31 bytes/characters would be &lt;strong>silently&lt;/strong> truncated on save. Despite the &amp;lsquo;credentials saved, rebooting&amp;rsquo; message, the next screen was always a &amp;lsquo;failure to connect&amp;rsquo; message. Frustrating! The pull request to address this is &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/pull/117">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hardware">Hardware&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The HASP does support dimming the LCD, but it has no awareness of ambient light levels. This makes it rather difficult to deploy a HASP in any &amp;lsquo;light sensitive&amp;rsquo; location like a bedroom or media room without another device to cue Home Assistant and lower the LCD brightness. Workable, but too high friction to be ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Light Dependent Resistors - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor">LDR&lt;/a> for short - are a very cheap and compact way to get an approximate light level. Fortunately, the analogue pin is broken out on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/tree/master/PCB">PCB&lt;/a> so a simple &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider#Resistive_divider">resistive divider&lt;/a> and a few lines of code are all that&amp;rsquo;s needed to get a a number that linearly correlates to the level of light hitting the face plate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It just so happens that there is &lt;em>just enough&lt;/em> room to fit a LDR beneath the surface of the decor plate and out of the way of the LCD. As (not) shown in the picture above, there is no way to tell that the LDR is embedded beneath the surface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The range of values from the LDR isn&amp;rsquo;t great, but they are adequate enough to reliably detect if the HASP is in a darkened room.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/ldr-graph.jpg" alt="Screenshot depicting graph of LDR values, rising over time. Annotated to indicate sharp rise in brightness right around sunrise" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
ignore the spikes just before noon, those are due to to testing with a flash light
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>While researching potential ways to measure the ambient brightness, I stumbled across the &lt;a href="https://shop.homeseer.com/products/z-wave-dimmer-switch">HomeSeer HS-WD200+&lt;/a> which features a rather novel way to convey additional information to a user; seven RGB leds 😍. It&amp;rsquo;s a brilliant use of such a simple and ubiquitous technology that I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure why every smart switch doesn&amp;rsquo;t do this!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/HS-WD200-Modes.jpg" alt="Picture showing tools/materials required for assembly" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
HomeSeer&amp;#39;s WS200 has a delightful innovation... RGB LEDs!
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>With &lt;em>zero&lt;/em> room to spare, four LEDs can fit into a small cavity between the LCD and decor plate surface. Like with the LDR, there is no visual &amp;lsquo;tell&amp;rsquo; that there are LEDs beneath the surface&amp;hellip; unless they&amp;rsquo;re on, of course.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/prototype-leds.jpg" alt="Picture showing a prototype HASP with LEDs embedded beneath the surface and powered on" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
Ignore the dirt on the switch. Notice how you can&amp;#39;t tell there&amp;#39;s an LDR beneath the surface
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h4 id="the-enclosure">The enclosure&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Without consuming more than 1 &lt;a href="https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/11654/what-does-1-gang-2-gang-and-so-forth-mean-when-talking-about-electrical-bo">gang&lt;/a>, the only realistic way to get the wires for the new components to the HASP PCB is to go around the edge of the LCD&amp;rsquo;s PCB. This is accomplished with two small &amp;lsquo;channels&amp;rsquo; that slightly protrude in the vertical directions from the lip around the LCD and into the box that encloses the electronics.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/CAD-channel-profile.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Fusion360, showing side profile of HASP, annotated to indicate channels in enclosure for wires leading to LED tape, LDR in relation to LCD" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Additionally, I found that the original printed parts do not properly fit in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thomas-Betts-B232A-UPC-Carlon-Bulk/dp/B000GAWYZ8/">two gang electrical box&lt;/a> where I intended to deploy the HASP.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
The only way to fit the HASP in my 2-gang electric boxes is to cut out a small section
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In total, the modifications required to accommodate the LDR and LED tape are relatively small, but &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/issues/116">I had to re-create the model from scratch&lt;/a> so several things are likely a bit different from the original model. It should be relatively easy to port the modifications to the other multi-gang configurations that the original HASP supports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>.step&lt;/code> and &lt;code>.f3z&lt;/code> files are available should you want to make the necessary modifications to other switch plate configurations.
The &lt;code>.stl&lt;/code> and &lt;code>.3mf&lt;/code> files are available for easy printing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All files available &lt;a href="#files">below&lt;/a> and on &lt;a href="https://github.com/kquinsland/HASwitchPlate/tree/master/3D_Printable_Models/enhanced-HASP">github&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="assembly">Assembly&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The steps below are meant to be followed between the original steps &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/blob/master/Documentation/03_Electronics_Assembly.md">&lt;code>03_Electronics_Assembly&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/blob/master/Documentation/04_Project_Enclosure.md">&lt;code>04_Project_Enclosure&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to assemble and test the HASP PCB as in the original instructions, but use the steps below as a substitute for the enclosure assembly process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="additional-materials">Additional Materials&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In addition to everything in the original BOM, you&amp;rsquo;ll need:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A LDR. Be aware that LDRs come in many different shapes and sizes and have different resistance values. Space is rather tight, so the form factor matters a lot more than the resistance values or band of light that the LDR responds to. If you use a different LDR, you may need to adjust the resistor value to better match your LDR. You can get 50 of the exact model GL5516 that I used for less than $2 &lt;a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_dUjV8Rn">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A 10KΩ resistor to form a simple resistive divider with the LDR. This will better map the the full range of the LDR to the 0-1 volt range that the ESP8266 ADC uses. Space is rather limited so the smaller the resistor, the better; no need for anything larger than 1/4 Watt. You can get a 10-pack of 10KΩ resistors &lt;a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F10-Pcs-1-8-Watt-1-Metal-Film-Resistor-Choose-you-own-values-USA-SELLER%2F302971259661&amp;amp;campid=5338745533&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;customid=">here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>WS2812B LED tape &lt;strong>featuring the 3535SMD package&lt;/strong>. The &amp;lsquo;regular size&amp;rsquo; LED package &lt;em>will &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> fit&lt;/em> so make sure you use the smaller &lt;code>3535SMD&lt;/code> package! Beyond that, aim for LED tape that is no wider than ~8mm and has highest density possible. After quite some searching, the best that I could find is 8mm wide tape with a density of 144 LEDs per meter. Unfortunately, they don&amp;rsquo;t sell LEDs 4 at a time, so you can pick up 1 meter of the exact LEDs I used &lt;a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FNarrow-DC-5V-WS2812B-Led-Strip-Individually-Addressable-WS2812-Led-pixel-Light%2F254647279915%3Fhash%3Ditem3b4a29212b%3Ag%3A9D8AAOSwIZ5fBTn7&amp;amp;campid=5338745533&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;customid=pixel_tape">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Several centimeters of very fine gauge wire. Ideally, multiple colors so you can keep organized but this is not required. Again, space is rather tight, so AWG 28 or 30 is ideal. Much bigger than that and you&amp;rsquo;ll likely have issues fitting everything together. You can get a 1m length of multiple colors &lt;a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FNarrow-DC-5V-WS2812B-Led-Strip-Individually-Addressable-WS2812-Led-pixel-Light%2F254647279915%3Fhash%3Ditem3b4a29212b%3Ag%3A9D8AAOSwIZ5fBTn7&amp;amp;campid=5338745533&amp;amp;toolid=10001">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>HeatShrink Tubing (HST). The exact diameter needed will depend on how compact your soldering is and the size of resistor used. Multiple colors will help keep things organized, but that&amp;rsquo;s not required. I suggest a kit so you can get the perfect diameter and length. You can get a kit &lt;a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F360pcs-2-1-Heat-Shrink-Tube-Tubing-Sleeving-Wrap-Wire-cable-Insulated-Assorted%2F224122863249%3Fhash%3Ditem342ec37e91%3Ag%3AMbcAAOSwXGhfPCNK&amp;amp;campid=5338745533&amp;amp;toolid=10001">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Standard 2.54mm pin headers. You can get a set of male and female headers &lt;a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F10pcs-Male-Header-1x40-2-54mm-40-Pin-PCB-Through-Hole-Arduino-and-Pi%2F223105297271%3Fepid%3D28022683725%26hash%3Ditem33f21cab77%3Ag%3A~X8AAOSwvFpbdZWA&amp;amp;campid=5338745533&amp;amp;toolid=10001">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>: Where possible, I&amp;rsquo;ve used commission links. The links don&amp;rsquo;t raise the price of any item, they simply let the retailer know that I&amp;rsquo;m the reason for your business.

&lt;h3 id="brass-inserts">Brass inserts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The original instructions suggest using glue to secure the brass inserts to the face plate, but I suggest using either a lighter or a very fine tip soldering iron to heat up the brass insert. A hot insert will melt the surrounding plastic which will make for a much stronger joint. The modified version of the HASP face plate used in this guide intentionally features holes slightly too small for the brass inserts so glue won&amp;rsquo;t be enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fully insert the 20mm screw into the brass insert, use pliers to grasp the screw and apply heat with a lighter for a few seconds and then insert into the face plate. Make sure that the screw is &lt;strong>completely&lt;/strong> inserted into the insert so that molten plastic can&amp;rsquo;t flow into the insert. If molten plastic enters and cools on the threads, it will be rather difficult to later screw things together!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are only six wires for the two components and the LED tape is the only component where polarity matters. A table mapping each pin on the HASP PCB to each component lead is below.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>You are &lt;strong>strongly&lt;/strong> encouraged to test / check your work after each step with a simple multimeter. Complete assembly involves irreversible steps, like shrinking HST. If you make a mistake, it&amp;rsquo;s best to catch it before &amp;lsquo;finalizing&amp;rsquo; things as you&amp;rsquo;re almost certainly going to have to destroy the component and or wiring harness to repair it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, you can flash my &lt;a href="https://github.com/kquinsland/HASwitchPlate">modified HASP firmware&lt;/a> to a fully assembled HASP device and use that as a testing device. On boot up, the modified firmware briefly flashes each LED in sequence. About every 10 seconds after boot, the LDR value will be read and published to MQTT. Cover the LDR with your hand and check your MQTT broker or HA to confirm that the value changes significantly between exposed and covered states.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="ldr">LDR&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Fit the LDR into the face plate and position the leads in the channel under and to the top of the LCD PCB. Then trim the excess length off of the LDR leads so that they extend &amp;lsquo;beyond&amp;rsquo; the LCD by about 8mm or so.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/assembly/03.ldr-position.jpg" alt="Picture showing the LDR in position under the LCD with it&amp;#39;s leads trimmed slightly" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Remove the LDR from the face plate and straighten the leads out. Lay the LDR, resistor, and wire out as shown below. Use this time to cut the HST down to size so everything but the leg of the LDR that joins the resistor can be covered. &lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> the leads on the resistor have also been trimmed down to ~15mm to better fit.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s probably going to be easiest to start with the &amp;lsquo;supply&amp;rsquo; wire which runs directly from the HASP PCB&amp;rsquo;s +3.3v pin to the LDR. As space is exceedingly tight, there is no room for overly large solder joints. Carefully wrap the wire around the lead and apply just enough solder to make good electrical contact. Once the supply wire has been soldered to the LDR, affix the HST so the entirety of the lead and solder joint are protected.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
strip ~1cm off the end of the wire, wrap around the lead, then solder
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Repeat the same procedure with the lead of the resistor that will go directly to the ground. Affix the HST after the solder joint has cooled.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Use the same &amp;lsquo;wrap&amp;rsquo; technique with the remaining leads from the LDR and the resistor. Apply just enough solder for good electrical contact between the signal wire and the two leads of the LDR and resistor.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;/figure>

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
get everything nicely protected behind HST
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Set the LDR component aside for now and move on to the LED tape.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="leds">LEDs&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve not already trimmed the LED tape to fit in the face plate, do so now. Leave yourself as much room as needed to solder on the one side where you&amp;rsquo;ll need to feed power and data in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The LED tape has incredibly small pads so take your time on this. You have about 5 cubic millimeters &lt;em>total&lt;/em> for the three solder joints on the LED tape. Solder just enough for electrical contact, there will be no significant mechanical stress. &lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> The arrows printed on the strip point in the direction of data flow; combined with the off-center placement of the LED packages, there is only one way to properly install the LED tape in the decor plate.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;figcaption>

know which way the LED tape wires will need to point to make it into the &amp;#39;channel&amp;#39; prior to soldering
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>After soldering the power, signal and ground wires, flatten them and gently shape them so they align and flow into the channel on the face plate in a manner similar to the LDR. For a bit of mechanical robustness, consider braiding the wires together.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/assembly/10.twisted-cable.jpg" alt="picture showing three wires from LED tape carefully braised together for a more compact and stronger cable" />

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h5 id="pin-header">Pin Header&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>After soldering wires onto the two components, all that&amp;rsquo;s left is soldering the wires to the correct pins on the pin header.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One at a time, carefully take the pins out of the plastic &amp;lsquo;frame&amp;rsquo;. This is to prevent the heat from the soldering and HST steps from melting the plastic. Consider marking the pin with the location of the &amp;lsquo;frame&amp;rsquo; so you don&amp;rsquo;t take up too much room with the solder joint. You will need the &amp;lsquo;business end&amp;rsquo; of the pin to make good contact with the socket on the HASP board; this is quite difficult if most of the pin can&amp;rsquo;t be slid through the &amp;lsquo;frame&amp;rsquo; because of an excessively large solder joint!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/assembly/11.process.jpg" alt="picture showing single pin removed from pin header, about to be soldered" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
remove the pin from the plastic &amp;#39;frame&amp;#39; and carefully solder the wires to the pins
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Make sure that HST is on the wire(s) &lt;em>before&lt;/em> soldering! After the solder joint cools, slip the HST over the solder joint and apply heat until the joint is covered. Repeat this process for the remaining pins. There will be three &amp;lsquo;unused&amp;rsquo; pins that you can just ignore.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/10/enhanced-home-assistant-switch-plate-hasp/images/assembly/12.unused-pins.jpg" alt="picture showing the unused pins in the wire harness" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
A few pins are not needed
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>When all the wires have been soldered and covered, you&amp;rsquo;ll have something that looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Double check electrical connections and then combine the PCB, enclosure, plate and harness. Carefully align the &amp;lsquo;channels&amp;rsquo; for LDR and LED wires:&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="printing">Printing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the electrical boxes there&amp;rsquo;s absolutely no room to spare, so all parts are designed to fit together with &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong> tight clearances. Print as slow as you need to in order too achieve very good dimensional accuracy. Like with the brass inserts, the various screw holes are intentionally undersized for better thread engagement.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

The obvious orientation is the best, no supports needed
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The HASP does run a bit warm, but not any warmer than other smart switches with similar form-factor. PLA will likely be fine unless you in tend to deploy the HASP in a particularly hot location.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="thermals">Thermals&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In testing, the parts of the HASP ran ~20º above ambient. Most of that heat comes from the small AC-&amp;gt;DC converter and the LCD. Surprisingly, the ESP8266 does not emit that much heat. Overall, nothing particularly alarming, especially when the HASP is deployed into a larger multi-gang electrical box with with plenty of air to radiate heat into. Apologies in advance for the mixed ºC/ºF units.&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
Less heat is radiated through the front of the HASP; the LCD backlight and embedded LEDs are clearly the warmest components
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tiny PNP transistor that toggles the LCD power is the hottest component, by far. Everything else has a relatively consistent temperature:&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="future-work">Future work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I did accomplish my two main goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Ambient light sensor for more responsive backlight control&lt;/li>
&lt;li>HomeSeer-like LEDs for additional information display&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>However, there&amp;rsquo;s a few aspects of the HASP that i&amp;rsquo;d like to further improve:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Increased automatic configuration w/ the HASP. There&amp;rsquo;s still a non-trivial amount of work required to set up a HASP with Home Assistant. The HASP device has many different attributes that could be exposed to Home Assistant automatically. E.G.: The HASP will periodically check for a firmware update; the HASP should configure Home Assistant with a &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/binary_sensor.mqtt/#configuration">&lt;code>binary_sensor&lt;/code>&lt;/a> that indicates if there&amp;rsquo;s a firmware update available.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Some of the automations that live in Home Assistant to manage button presses / update screen content could probably be re-factored down to a few generic scripts and services.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The display uses a &lt;a href="https://forum.digikey.com/t/resistive-touch-vs-capacitive-touch-whats-the-difference/1063">resistive matrix&lt;/a> to detect touch events. Resistive screens, while cheap, are a bit finnicky and inferior to the more consistent and precise capacitive touch screen tech. If Nextion ever makes a capacitive version of the NX3224T024, then it would be an instant upgrade!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Similarly, the viewing angle on the LCD is&amp;hellip; not great. The HASP, like most light switches, is at a convenient height for hands&amp;hellip; not eyes. If you&amp;rsquo;re standing relatively close to the HASP, you&amp;rsquo;ll be looking down at the screen with quite a steep angle. Depending on the current screen brightness and colors, this may result in a washed out and illegible screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Better LED diffusion. There&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of space for light pipes or similar, but I would like to find a better way of diffusing the LEDs. Or even to fit a masking layer between the LEDs and the plate, so the effect would be akin to a back-lit silhouette.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Effects for the LEDs. Right now, the LEDs only support on/off/brightness commands. Their ability to passively indicate information would be enhanced if Home Assistant could send &amp;lsquo;effect&amp;rsquo; commands, too. E.G.: Rather than HA having to send a constant stream of color/brightness commands to fade between blue, green, yellow, purple, simply send a &lt;code>fade(2s) blue, green, yellow, purple&lt;/code> command.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of spare room on the HASP PCB for the 10KΩ resistor. This would simplify the creation of the wiring harness. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to learn KiKad, this might be a very gentle way to start learning it. 🤔&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Enclose the LED tape 100% inside the HASP. This version works well and the small &amp;lsquo;hole&amp;rsquo; in the enclosure. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s any safety concern w/ the current design, but I&amp;rsquo;d still like to have the low voltage stuff 100% blocked off from thee electrical box&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Since then, my weather station has been dutifully collecting data that&amp;rsquo;s been invaluable for augmenting automation that deals with indoor climate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the numerous wild fires in California rage on, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2020/08/21/wildfire-smoke-blankets-the-west-as-california-records-worlds-worst-air-quality/">the air quality has gone from bad to dangerous&lt;/a>. Knowing that outside was warmer, but less humid, was no longer enough to make a smart decision about weather or not to open the windows for some cost-effective cooling. I now need HomeAssistant to be aware of how clean the outside air was before making the decision to pipe in outdoor air.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post covers two things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A small update to the existing WS3 -&amp;gt; ESPHome -&amp;gt; HomeAssistant bridge code to take advantage of the WS3s' support for the ubiquitous &lt;code>PMS5003T&lt;/code> sensor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A simple 3d-printable enclosure for deploying the particulate matter sensor outdoors&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When deployed, it looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
Excuse the awkward camera angle; sensor is deployed in an awkward to photograph location.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Please ignore the awkward camera angle as the sensor is deployed in a location where there&amp;rsquo;s not quite enough room for proper camera placement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And results in graphs that look like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
Smoke particles are between .4μm to .7μm in size... which explains the elevated red line relative to other particle sizes.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>A simplified copy of this post appears on &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4581351">thingiverse&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/39560-outdoor-enclosure-for-pms5003-particulate-matter-s">prusaprinters&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-enclosure">The enclosure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As of writing, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4044492">one existing enclosure&lt;/a> for the sensor on thingiverse. Unfortunately, the enclosure does not appear to have any design features for mounting to a pole nor does it have any bug-proofing design elements. I took this opportunity to design my own that could be easily mounted, features a slanted &amp;lsquo;roof&amp;rsquo; to prevent standing moisture ingress and could use standard size tobacco pipe filters to keep all but the tiniest of insects/particles out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sensor uses a small fan to draw ambient air past an infrared laser. As airborne particles cross the laser beam, they reflect a certain amount of light which can be correlated with the size of the particle. This data can then be turned into fairly accurate counts of how many particles of a given size are in the sampled air. The enclosure is a basic box with two circular air channels pointed downwards to prevent moisture ingress. The intake and exhaust ports are at staggered heights and pointed in opposite directions and to minimize the chance of recirculating the same air.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lower port is the intake which connects to a few small holes on the front of the sensor and the exhaust port is the raised port which connects directly to the exhaust fan. If you could remove the first few mm from the front, it would look something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/08/adding-an-airborne-particulate-mater-sensor-to-ws3-weather-station/images/f360_air_channels.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing labeled ingress/egress for air flow" />
&lt;figcaption>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>From the side, you can see the two air channels and the few mm of room in the back for wiring. The sensor sits on a &amp;lsquo;pedestal&amp;rsquo; to keep it elevated away from any moisture that may collect on the bottom of the enclosure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The base plate/pedestal are secured to the &amp;lsquo;body&amp;rsquo; with two M3 screws. I used &lt;code>10mm&lt;/code> as that&amp;rsquo;s what I had on hand, but screws between 6-12mm should work as well. The holes are sized for a M3, but any similar sized screw will work. Use a lighter or similar to heat the screw as you drive it into the plastic to create your own threads if using a larger/longer screw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides the &amp;lsquo;pedestal&amp;rsquo; there are a few contact surfaces that hold on to the sensor with a friction fit. The &amp;lsquo;ceiling&amp;rsquo; is a few mm thick and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t permit much moisture ingress but an optional slanted roof component can be printed as an extra precaution.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While designing the enclosure, I used this &lt;a href="https://grabcad.com/library/pms5003-2">&lt;code>PMS5003&lt;/code> model&lt;/a> from Leclercq Gregory. 🙏&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="printing">Printing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is a functional part with only three small surfaces that require reasonably tight precision to properly hold onto the sensor. The &lt;code>SPEED&lt;/code> setting with a &lt;code>.2mm&lt;/code> layer height and a reasonable 20% infill gave me part that works and feels water tight. The walls and ceiling need to keep water out so dipping below 15% infill or otherwise using settings that wont give solid layer adhesion is not advised. I printed using ABS for durability, but PLA will probably work if you can deploy into a shaded environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The shroud and the base are not optional, the triangle shaped block is intended to turn the flat roof of the shroud into a slanted roof so water can&amp;rsquo;t collect. It is optional but shown below.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>collect materials&lt;/li>
&lt;li>press-fit the PM2.5 sensor into the enclosure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>make a wire that can interface the PM2.5 sensor to the WS3 board via RJ11&lt;/li>
&lt;li>seal everything up&lt;/li>
&lt;li>glue on mesh screens and angled roof&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Components:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32921725022.html">WS3 Weather Station&lt;/a> - Essential / Foundational&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FDigital-Universal-Particle-Concentration-Laser-Sensor-PMS5003-PM1-0-PM2-5-PM10%2F254616699639&amp;amp;campid=5338734064&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;customid=">ST5003T PM2.5 Sensor&lt;/a> - Essential / Foundational&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FTTGO-Wemos-MINI-D1-ESP32-WiFi-Bluetooth-Wemos-D1-Mini-ESP8266-ESP-32-Module%2F183413480551&amp;amp;campid=5338734064&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;customid=">ESP32 Device&lt;/a> - A link to the ESP32 based device that I use but any ESP platform with a spare GPIO that can be used as a UART will work.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F25-Stainless-Steel-Smoking-Pipe-Screens-3-4-19mm-Tobacco-HOOKAH-FILTER-Heavy%2F183969079809&amp;amp;campid=5338734064&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;customid=">3/4 inch tobacco pipe screens&lt;/a> - For bug/critter proofing the enclosure. Strongly suggested for outdoor deployments.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/91292A113/">2x M3 x 10mm screws&lt;/a> - Optional. The base can be glued to the shroud or any similar screw will work&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>: Where possible, I&amp;rsquo;ve used referral links. The links don&amp;rsquo;t raise the price of any item, they simply let the retailer know that I sent you and, in return, I get a small cut of your purchase. If you&amp;rsquo;re not comfortable with that, you can use a URL unwinding service to get the &amp;lsquo;raw&amp;rsquo; product link and drop the attribution/commission part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>General bits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Superglue&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waterproofing caulk/sealant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drill/Screwdriver&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Driver bit for the screws&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The stepped drill bit in the above picture is not a requirement if you assemble things in the correct oder. The cable egress hole is sized for a &amp;lsquo;typical&amp;rsquo; 3 pair &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_jack#RJ11,_RJ14,_RJ25_wiring">RJ11 cable&lt;/a> plus a tiny bit of wiggle room. I needed a working cable to test the code while the parts were printing so the hole in the printed base needed to be enlarged slightly to fit the head of the cable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wiring">Wiring&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no ready-made cable out there that&amp;rsquo;ll join the two devices so one must be made. Fortunately, there&amp;rsquo;s only 6 wires to deal with&amp;hellip; 4 of them are distinct.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sacrifice the cable that comes with the PM2.5 sensor and the RJ11 cable by cutting them in half and solder the correct wires together. The &lt;em>color&lt;/em> of the wires that come in both the RJ11 cable and the PM2.5 cable are likely going to differ from the ones I used so I&amp;rsquo;ve left those details out and provided a table showing which pins are to be joined together:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Pin #&lt;/th>
&lt;th>PM2.5 Sensor Pin&lt;/th>
&lt;th>WS3 Pin&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>1&lt;/td>
&lt;td>VCC&lt;/td>
&lt;td>5V&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>2&lt;/td>
&lt;td>GND&lt;/td>
&lt;td>GND&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>3&lt;/td>
&lt;td>SET&lt;/td>
&lt;td>ENABLE&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>4&lt;/td>
&lt;td>RX&lt;/td>
&lt;td>RX&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>5&lt;/td>
&lt;td>TX&lt;/td>
&lt;td>GND&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>6&lt;/td>
&lt;td>RESET&lt;/td>
&lt;td>5V&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>7&lt;/td>
&lt;td>NC&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>8&lt;/td>
&lt;td>NC&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>For reference, Pin 1 on both the WS3 and PM2.5 Sensor:&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>With the wiring done, the sensor just needs to be stuffed into the enclosure. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to thread the RJ11 cable through the hole in the base plate &lt;em>BEFORE&lt;/em> soldering it to the cable for the PM2.5 sensor&amp;hellip; otherwise you&amp;rsquo;ll need that stepped drill bit! 🙃&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>
Sensor has been press-fit into the enclosure and wire fed through the base plate.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>To finish, secure the base with screws and a bit of water-proofing caulk for good measure:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;p>
I suggest waiting until the end to glue on the optional roof and waiting until just before that to glue on the optional mesh screens.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="the-code">The code&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Setting up and using ESPHome is outside the scope of this post but there are several &lt;a href="https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html">good guides&lt;/a> out there. Once you have that set up, &lt;a href="https://esphome.io/custom/custom_component.html">include&lt;/a> the &lt;code>ws3.h&lt;/code> file and set up your custom sensor as shown below. A working example and more detail is over on the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/kquinsland/ws3-to-esphome-bridge/">github repo&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;ll look like this:&lt;/p>

Record breaking temperatures results in a distribution grid stressed beyond it&amp;rsquo;s abilities which guarantees blackouts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Independent_System_Operator">organization that oversees the electric grid&lt;/a> in California publishes RSS feeds for various types of grid related news and events. All the CA ISO RSS feeds are published &lt;a href="http://www.caiso.com/Pages/GlobalRSS.aspx">here&lt;/a>, but the two feed that I&amp;rsquo;m using are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://content.caiso.com/awe/noticeRSS.xml">http://content.caiso.com/awe/noticeRSS.xml&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://content.caiso.com/awe/noticeflexRSS.xml">http://content.caiso.com/awe/noticeflexRSS.xml&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As energy demand ramps up, &lt;code>flex&lt;/code> alerts are issued as a call to reduce energy consumption. If demand continues to rise &lt;code>warnings&lt;/code> and, finally, &lt;code>stage3&lt;/code> events are issued. A &lt;code>warning&lt;/code> does not guarantee a &lt;code>stage3&lt;/code> event, but a &lt;code>stage3&lt;/code> event mans that blackouts are all but inevitable in the coming hours. The &lt;em>exact&lt;/em> meaning of each alert type is outlined in &lt;a href="https://www.caiso.com/Documents/SystemAlertsWarningsandEmergenciesFactSheet.pdf">this PDF&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>noticeRSS.xml&lt;/code> feed, has &lt;em>early&lt;/em> warning notifications that look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">&amp;lt;item&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
\n
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span>NOTICE 202002440: CAISO Grid Warning Issued &lt;span style="font-weight:bold">&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
\n
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/span>http://www.caiso.com/awe/noticelog.html#202002440&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
\n
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">&amp;lt;description&amp;gt;&lt;/span>Effective: 16-Aug-2020 12:00 PM Terminates: 16-Aug-2020 11:59 PM&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">&amp;lt;/description&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
\n
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">&amp;lt;/item&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Note: there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong w/ your browser, the &lt;code>\n&lt;/code> characters &lt;em>are&lt;/em> in the actual feed. No matter, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/feedreader">RSS parser&lt;/a> in Home Assistant &lt;em>can&lt;/em> tolerate them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use the alerts/warnings to do a few simple tasks, but there&amp;rsquo;s so much potential beyond the automation I currently have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>bumps thermostats up by a few degrees to lighten demand*&lt;/li>
&lt;li>re-schedule a few routine activities that are usually done in the evening to as soon as possible (cooking, for example)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>notify me to immediately go check that the generator has fuel&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Currently in &amp;lsquo;unarmed&amp;rsquo; mode as I tweak the logic driving the decision&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Basically, add the two feeds above to the &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/feedreader/">feedreader&lt;/a> integration and use the &lt;code>feedreader&lt;/code> type of &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#event-trigger">event&lt;/a> to trigger your automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Somewhere in &lt;code>configuration.yaml&lt;/code>, load the &lt;code>feedreader&lt;/code> component.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">feedreader&lt;/span>: !include feedreader/rss.yaml
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>and in the &lt;code>feedreader/rss.yaml&lt;/code> file, add the URLs:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">urls&lt;/span>:
- http://content.caiso.com/awe/noticeRSS.xml
- http://content.caiso.com/awe/noticeflexRSS.xml
&lt;span style="font-style:italic"># Pull down the feed 2x/ hour&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">scan_interval&lt;/span>:
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">minutes&lt;/span>: 30
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Unfortunately, Home Assistant does not support setting the &lt;code>scan_interval&lt;/code> per feed, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to figure out a happy middle ground if you&amp;rsquo;ve already got a few RSS feeds you monitor. Likewise, don&amp;rsquo;t pull the feed down excessively&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t see a lot of evidence that the feed is cached well and the CA ISO does occasionally have to put banners on the top of their site saying that the site is under heavy load. Don&amp;rsquo;t be the reason the site goes down because &lt;em>you&lt;/em> wanted &lt;strong>instant&lt;/strong> notification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re not in a position to do any sophisticated automation based on the notification, it&amp;rsquo;s still simple to fire off a notification to &lt;em>manually&lt;/em> prepare:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">&lt;span style="font-style:italic">##&lt;/span>

&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">service&lt;/span>: persistent_notification.create
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">data_template&lt;/span>:
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">notification_id&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="font-style:italic">&amp;#34;{{ trigger.event.data.title }}&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">title&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="font-style:italic">&amp;#34;FlexAlert&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold">message&lt;/span>: &amp;gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic">
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-style:italic"> {% set tokens = trigger.event.data.description.split(&amp;#39; &amp;#39;) %}
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-style:italic"> {% set start_str = &amp;#34;{} {} {}&amp;#34;.format(tokens[1], tokens[2], tokens[3]) %}
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-style:italic"> {% set start = strptime(start_str, &amp;#39;%d-%b-%Y %I:%M %p&amp;#39;) %}
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-style:italic"> {% set end_str = &amp;#34;{} {} {}&amp;#34;.format(tokens[5], tokens[6], tokens[7]) %}
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-style:italic"> {% set end = strptime(end_str, &amp;#39;%d-%b-%Y %I:%M %p&amp;#39;) %}
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-style:italic"> &amp;#34;Heads up, electricity demand is likely to exceed production from {{ start.isoformat() }} to {{ end.isoformat() }}&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Which should create a simple notification that&amp;rsquo;ll look something like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>strptime&lt;/code> function yields &lt;code>start&lt;/code> and &lt;code>end&lt;/code> objects that can be manipulated further:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">{% set now = now() %}
{% if start.day &amp;gt; now.day -%}
It looks like demand will be high *tomorrow*
{%- endif %}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Happy automating.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Announcing The Missing ToDoist Tools</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/2020/07/announcing-the-missing-todoist-tools/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/2020/07/announcing-the-missing-todoist-tools/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="tmtdt-the-missing-todoist-tools-">TMTDT: The Missing ToDoist Tools 🎉&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As the name implies, TMTDT started as a small collection of scripts that I used to augment ToDoist with features they can&amp;rsquo;t/won&amp;rsquo;t implement. It&amp;rsquo;s grown quite a bit since then.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;img src="https://karlquinsland.com/2020/07/announcing-the-missing-todoist-tools/images/demo.gif" alt="I don&amp;#39;t know how to make flashy demo gifs." />

&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Those scripts started as simple idea and quickly morphed into a creaky, but essential, tool. As more features were added it continued too morph into an unmaintainable mess. Untangling that mess was on my todo list but never a high priority partly because of issues TMTDT was designed to solve 🤦.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I lost my day job right as the spring of 2020 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay-at-home_order#COVID-19_pandemic">shelter in place&lt;/a> order was put in place. TMTDT is certainly not how I &lt;em>thought&lt;/em> early summer was going to be spent, but a useful way nonetheless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One significant chunk of my newly-freed time and a lengthy re-write later, I had something that looked promising. After a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> more work and some tinkering, I&amp;rsquo;ve got something that feels like far more than a hacky tool for personal use.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why">Why&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Why not?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had several scripts that I would run on a regular basis to do things like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>set up projects with multiple different types of templates based on things like the date&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fix typos i routinely made while &lt;a href="https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/115001745265-Task-Quick-Add">quick adding&lt;/a> tasks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>re-schedule certain daily tasks if they had been missed&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>No joke, I&amp;rsquo;d spend a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of time fixing typos, expanding ideas for a project into proper sub-tasks and sections and other routine administrative work:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;p>
Representative of time spent during a typical week
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In that specific week, I kept track of how 37 hours were spent. Of those 37, about 4 were spent on general Inbox review / process. At least 3 of those 4 were spent &lt;em>directly&lt;/em> on task triage. 3/37 is about 8%. With no full time day job - &lt;a href="https://karlquinsland.com/contact/">hire me&lt;/a> - that&amp;rsquo;s a fairly representative breakdown for a given week; some time planning the things, lots of time doing the things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What would you do with 8% of your time back each week?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m kidding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We all know that I&amp;rsquo;m not getting any free time back from this.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve written this software to suit my needs, but the decision to make it a bit more robust and featured before release is because I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a few &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; tools to better augment ToDoist:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/Hoffelhas/autodoist">autodoist&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/todoist-shortcuts-gmail-v/dehmghpdcahlffompjagejmgbcfahndp">shortcuts&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/6uhrmittag/taskbutler">taskbutler&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://planner-todo.web.app/">planner&lt;/a>. This is more of a UI, but it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong> pretty app.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And I&amp;rsquo;m genuinely curious about how other people will user it. I am always appreciative when somebody finds a smart way to save some time and shares their trick. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping somebody figures out how to use this tool in a way that I can learn from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An announcement post for TMTDT is now on &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/todoist/comments/hyfl3o/introducing_the_missing_todoist_tools_a/">/r/todoist&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how">How&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The code and some documentation can be found on &lt;a href="https://github.com/kquinsland/the-missing-todoist-tools">GitHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The demo gif at the top of this post illustrates a simple example, but more through (read: contrived) examples are included in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/kquinsland/the-missing-todoist-tools/tree/master/jobs/v1">jobs&lt;/a> directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The short version:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Scriptable tools for building jobs to manage a TooDoist account&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Slightly longer version:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Architecture inspired by Elastic Search&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/elastic/curator/tree/master/curator">Curator&lt;/a>. Functionality built for ToDoist.&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m playing around with porting a few different applications over to k8. Some of them - like &lt;a href="https://github.com/kquinsland/skyhole/">skyhole&lt;/a> - rely on UDP packets which my hosted k8 provider of choice (read: cheapest! 💰) &lt;a href="https://ideas.digitalocean.com/ideas/DO-I-310">does not support&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution is either:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Keep track of all of the node IP addresses that have an exposed &lt;code>nodePort&lt;/code> and have the client connect directly to the cluster on the &lt;code>nodePort&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Set up some sort of intermediary to re-write the packet from the &lt;code>targetPort&lt;/code> &lt;strong>to&lt;/strong> the &lt;code>nodePort&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Option 1 seems fragile; if a cluster host / node is recycled, the client needs to learn the new correct IP addresses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Option 2 seems far more flexible and is basically how most hosted k8 providers do ingress already. In fact, if digital ocean &lt;em>had&lt;/em> UDP support, this tool would never have been created. Bonus: clients that expect a specific port can still connect to the service no matter what &lt;code>nodePort&lt;/code> is used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that&amp;rsquo;s what &lt;a href="https://github.com/kquinsland/cloud-agnostic-protocol-proxy">&lt;code>CAPP&lt;/code>&lt;/a> is: &lt;strong>C&lt;/strong>loud &lt;strong>A&lt;/strong>gnostic &lt;strong>P&lt;/strong>rotocol &lt;strong>P&lt;/strong>roxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a repo w/ a small python tool which can collect the IP addresses(s) belonging to each node in an arbitrary k8 cluster and - when combined with a small user config file - generate configuration files for &lt;code>traefik&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &amp;lsquo;reference&amp;rsquo; packer job is included to generate a basic machine image to host traefik.

&lt;p>And i want to test out the &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#gist">hugo shortcode for embedding a gist&lt;/a> 😏.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The really short version:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Create a dedicated interface that can only be accessed from the local system&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bind the consul-agent&amp;rsquo;s DNS service to this local only interface&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tell &lt;a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-resolved.service.html">&lt;code>systemd-resolved&lt;/code>&lt;/a> that all hostnames with the &lt;code>.consul&lt;/code> TLD can be resolved via a DNS server on this local interface&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>No need to disable &lt;code>resolved&lt;/code> and replace it with dnsmasq 😄&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I needed some horizontal / vertical cable rings for cat5 and power cables. I would have used the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3315960">1U Rackmount Cable Management Rings&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/boulwarek/about">boulwarek&lt;/a> except the hole spacing didn&amp;rsquo;t work for my application. I needed cable rings for the &amp;lsquo;front-to-back&amp;rsquo; braces which have distinct dimensions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>holes needed to be spaced &lt;code>10.85mm&lt;/code> apart&lt;/li>
&lt;li>distance between center of screw is &lt;code>20.0mm&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>I made the rings slightly smaller as the horizontal / vertical runs I needed rings for do not carry more than a few cables.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While drafting this post, I discovered that there appears to be a newer version of the RD6006: the 6012. As far as I can tell, they&amp;rsquo;re in the same &amp;lsquo;family&amp;rsquo; and have the same dimensions so the CAD and related model files below &lt;em>should&lt;/em> work w/ the RD6012 just as they do w/ the 6006, but i can only &amp;lsquo;guarantee&amp;rsquo; that the CAD and related model files below will work with the &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/riden-rd6006/">RD6006&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A version of this post appears on &lt;a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/36338-poe-and-qc30-adapter-for-rd6006-psu">prusaprinters&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4536551">thingiverse&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what">What&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A small enclosure for a PoE injector and QC 3.0 charger designed to sit on top of the RD6012 PSU &amp;lsquo;kit&amp;rsquo; sold all over aliexpress and banggood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assembled, it looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The RD6006 is incredibly versatile, but can only supply power for about 85% of the devices that make their way onto my &amp;lsquo;healing&amp;rsquo; bench. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t keen on taking up more valuable space with a device dedicated to PoE injection so finding a way to mod one into the PSU seemed like a good idea. Similarly, adding a versatile USB port seemed like a no-brainer as my &lt;a href="http://www.miniware.com.cn/product/ts80-soldering-iron-more/">favorite soldering iron&lt;/a> is powered via QuickCharge 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three useful bench tools, one footprint, one consumed power outlet. What&amp;rsquo;s not to love?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="printing">Printing:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are two components for this build:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the &amp;lsquo;plate&amp;rsquo; which rests on the top of the PSU case and has small &amp;lsquo;fences&amp;rsquo; to fix the circuit boards in place. It&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;lsquo;salmon&amp;rsquo; colored component&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the &amp;lsquo;lid&amp;rsquo; is the (mostly) transparent yellow component which holds the auxiliary power supplies (pink components) in place and keeps all voltages away from people.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;figure >

&lt;h4>Colorized Components&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>
Relevant components, colored in F360
&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I used black PETG, but any material and at least 10% infill should be fine. Tune the layer height to taste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;lsquo;plate&amp;rsquo; does not need any supports nor does the lid if printed in the suggested print orientation shown below 👇. I printed with settings optimized for speed so there was minimal sagging, but nothing substantial. What little there was didn&amp;rsquo;t interfere with clearance of any other internal component and was completely hidden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re not comfortable with bridging long distances, you can optionally enforce support material from the build plate to the top of the lid &lt;strong>or&lt;/strong> flip the lid upside down and use supports for the four feet where the screws go. Because any sagging would be hidden inside,&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="components">Components&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In addition to the miscellaneous wire and crimp connectors, there are two components used in this design:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33019891423.html">PoE injector&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y9HP4KM/">QC 3.0 Charger&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="assembly">Assembly&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t have any pictures from the assembly 😞, but it&amp;rsquo;s not particularly difficult to figure out from the attached pictures. In general, the steps to take are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="0">
&lt;li>Print everything and clean up the parts as needed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>de-shell the PoE injector and QC3 charger. A plastic pry-tool or a few flat-head screwdrivers will help here!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>desolder the existing mains connections from both modules and solder on new ones. The new ones don&amp;rsquo;t need to be long, just a bit longer than the leads that came on the module PCBs!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>disconnect power from the assembled PSU and remove the case cover&lt;/li>
&lt;li>place the &amp;lsquo;plate&amp;rsquo; onto the top of the PSU and use a pencil to mark all 5 holes on the cover&lt;/li>
&lt;li>remove the plate, drill out all 5 holes and use a file to smooth down any sharp edges on the big hole as that&amp;rsquo;s where the mains wires will go. A burr poking through insulation means the case may become energized @ mains voltages! 💥 💀&lt;/li>
&lt;li>crimp connectors onto wires and attach to the mains supply &lt;strong>after&lt;/strong> the switch and fuse!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>place the &amp;lsquo;plate&amp;rsquo; back onto the PSU cover&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run the wires through the new hole in the top of the PSU case and through the hole in the &amp;lsquo;plate&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add the PoE injector and QC3 module to the plate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>join the mains leads to the module leads. I used &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wago-221-413-LEVER-NUTS-Conductor-Connectors/dp/B06XGYXVXR/">Wago&lt;/a> connectors, but simple wirenuts or a screw terminal block will work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use M3 screws to secure the lid to the plate and the PSU. I intentionally drilled the holes slightly too small so the screws would thread against the case. Not ideal, but works absolutely fine for something that&amp;rsquo;s not load-bearing or going to be repeatedly re-screwed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>re-connect the IEC power connector and power on&lt;/li>
&lt;li>monitor for sounds and smells that indicate you screwed up. begin testing PoE and USB port for proper power.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Just prior to seating the &amp;lsquo;lid&amp;rsquo; you should have something like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what">What&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Taking the side / rear of my rack off every time I needed to change which host(s) were connected to the monitor was starting to get old. Only recently did I realize that you can fit more than just RJ45 jacks in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_module">Keystone Jack&lt;/a>. A few measurements, a quick search through thingiverse and some CAD time later, this is the result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The model is tailored to my specific rack, but should be easily adoptable to any other dimensions. Import the Fusion360 model and then edit the first sketch in the timeline as needed and adjust the &lt;code>pattern on line&lt;/code> step to adjust the number of keystone jacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, you can always just glue the print to whichever surface you need it mounted on as there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of broad/flat surface for adhesive if the two built-in screw holes won&amp;rsquo;t work!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As is, the model has:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>8 jacks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>178.5mm&lt;/code> from &amp;lsquo;edge&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;edge&amp;rsquo; between the two screw holes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>6.5mm&lt;/code> diameter for the holes as my rack uses M6 screws.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Note: After printing the model you see in the pictures below, I added a small cutout which should make it easier to depress the clip on the &amp;lsquo;male&amp;rsquo; end of a keystone device from the &amp;lsquo;user facing&amp;rsquo; side as you&amp;rsquo;d typically find on a proper patch panel&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with how it turned out: 8 jacks is more than enough for current and (projected!) future use. The only obvious improvement would be moving the numbers from the bottom to the top where there&amp;rsquo;s more room. As it is now, the perimeters around the numbers look a bit weird as they merge w/ the bottom edge that are flush w/ the rack and the top edges that are flush w/ the jacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/belfers/about">&lt;code>belfers&lt;/code>&lt;/a> for the &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3150524">Keystone model&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The details are on the &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4536257">thingiverse&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/36325-8-port-keystone-patch-panel">prusaprinters&lt;/a> page.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="printing">Printing:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Any material and at least 10% infill should be fine.
No supports if you use the suggested print orientation shown in picture below.
Tolerances on the jacks are somewhat tight so printing at a more accurate setting is probably going to be a good idea.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with a few different ways to surface various home automation controls in the appropriate place and at a good time. One prototype host is deployed behind a small LCD under some cabinets in a high traffic area. This host is a raspberry pi 4 with a &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/poe-hat/">PoE hat&lt;/a>. It boots a very stripped down version of &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/">Raspberry Pi OS&lt;/a> into a web browser running in Kiosk mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple and does many things well. There&amp;rsquo;s a few small issues that need to be addressed in the CAD files as well as some additional electronic improvements that should be made before I can publish the design / files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any event, this host has been trouble-free until recently. Simple &lt;code>apt update&lt;/code> transfers would take &lt;strong>DAYS&lt;/strong> to complete, simple &lt;code>scp&lt;/code> operations to other hosts on the LAN would trickle by at tens of kB/s. The web app that the host is primarily responsible for displaying would time out or fail to completely load resulting in some &amp;ldquo;a-for-effort&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="https://www.mavenecommerce.com/2017/10/31/progressive-enhancement-vs-graceful-degradation/">graceful degradation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-facts">The Facts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As soon as I bring up the &lt;code>wlan0&lt;/code> interface and bring down the &lt;code>eth0&lt;/code> interface performance is IMMEDIATELY restored. The web app is responsive and fully loads instantly, &lt;code>scp&lt;/code> is fast like it should be on a LAN and &lt;code>apt update&lt;/code> completes without any errors as fast as my internet connection will let it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>: The problem is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> network related. Both the &lt;code>eth0&lt;/code> and &lt;code>wlan0&lt;/code> interface are on the same &lt;code>vLan&lt;/code> so the bizarre behavior is not likely caused by a QoS policy or firewall rule.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rPi and a few other hosts a powered via a a &lt;a href="https://shop.poetexas.com/products/at-4-48v120w/">120 watt&lt;/a> which is in the same closet as my core switch. Two terminations and about 200 feet of cat5 cable later, you get to the rPi host on the other side of the house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Continuity tester was used on every segment of the link to confirm the link is good. The segments of the link from the switch to the injector and to the patch-panel all use high quality pre-made cables, as does the final segment from the wall to the rPi. Shocker, they tested fine, just like the in-wall segment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, no other host on the PoE injector is misbehaving. No other host on the PoE injector is indicating that there&amp;rsquo;s not enough power, and the power supply feeding the injector isn&amp;rsquo;t even warm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>: The cables are certainly fine and the PoE injector is &lt;em>probably fine&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I disabled the PoE injector all together and use the USBC port on the rPi for power. It was just as performant as with WiFi! I did not expect this result, but it did certainly narrow down the possible problem areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>: The problem is only present when the host is powered via PoE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was very confident that the PoE injector was not the problem, but in order to be certain, I used a second cheap PoE injector that lives on my bench power supply. Turns out, the same slow speeds manifested with the second injector, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>: The problem is not in the network, nor is it in the cables, nor is it in the injectors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This only leaves one candidate: the host. Unfortunately, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing about the host that screams &amp;ldquo;i&amp;rsquo;m the problem!&amp;rdquo;. The microSD card is new and very fast. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing in the logs indicating a hardware failure. On-device performance (via non-networking benchmarks) is inline with what i&amp;rsquo;d expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s two additional facts from some brief testing I did a few weeks ago. I had more or less forgotten about them and only really remembered that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>When I tried a fresh install of Ubuntu on a fresh microSD card&amp;hellip; same slow speeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The host performs &lt;em>perfectly&lt;/em> when plugged into other networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I was &lt;em>confident&lt;/em> then, that the rPi was not the issue and that something about the network was. But I just spent 3 hours systematically testing out every component of the network and concluding that the network is fine!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>: I&amp;rsquo;m back where I started; angry and confused.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;ah ha!&amp;rdquo; moment didn&amp;rsquo;t come until i decided to try my second PoE injector &lt;em>at the client&lt;/em>. Much to my surprise, &lt;strong>it worked!&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a bit more testing, I determined that the PoE HAT on the rPi is &amp;lsquo;fine&amp;rsquo; when the PoE source is CLOSE&amp;hellip; which probably explains the &amp;lsquo;works fine on other networks&amp;rsquo; fact above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That leaves just the &amp;lsquo;problem is OS independent&amp;rsquo; fact which - after thoroughly vetting every part of the network and PoE system - makes it pretty obvious that the problem must be between the rPi and the cat5 cable coming from the wall. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>only&lt;/em> the PoE HAT between the rPi and the cat5 cable coming from the wall. I borrowed a PoE HAT from another host elsewhere on the network and the problematic rPi started behaving again. Network transfer speeds were appropriate and the web app / dashboard was performant again!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>: the PoE HAT powering a home automation dashboard has failed in such a way that makes the &lt;code>eth0&lt;/code> interface all but useless. replacing the HAT solved the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tldr">TL;DR:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Several months ago, the home automation dashboard displayed on a PoE powered rPi 4 started to act up. Further investigation showed absolute crap network performance from the host to any other point on the LAN or WAN. After testing each component in isolation, the PoE HAT was the only reaming suspect. After further investigation, the failure mode is &lt;em>not present&lt;/em> when the PoE source is &lt;em>close&lt;/em> to the client, only when the source is far from the client.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you have a PoE powered rPi project out there w/ abysmal &lt;code>eth0&lt;/code> performance, try replacing the PoE hat&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, if anybody knows &lt;em>why&lt;/em> this happened, I&amp;rsquo;d love to know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/2020/06/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/2020/06/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>Blowing the dust off the domain, trying Hugo out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>tap&lt;/em> &lt;em>tap&lt;/em> Is this thing on?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>home lab: consolidating multiple PSUs</title><link>https://karlquinsland.com/2020/06/home-lab-consolidating-multiple-psus/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlquinsland.com/2020/06/home-lab-consolidating-multiple-psus/</guid><description>&lt;p>A while back, I traded writing salt states and managing systemd &lt;code>.service&lt;/code> files wrapping &lt;code>podman&lt;/code> for the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wvEwPLcLcA">&amp;lsquo;simplicity&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a> of running kubernetes in my home lab. Jury is still out on weather or not the switch was worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cluster is a hodgepodge of second hand Intel NUCs and other scavenged compute hardware i&amp;rsquo;ve collected over the past few years. Some of it runs on 12v, some of it on 19v. For each node, there&amp;rsquo;s a dedicated switch mode power supply. Each supply takes up an outlet and brings a bit of cable mgmt related clutter. The solution is consolidation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So thats how this project came to be.&lt;/p>
