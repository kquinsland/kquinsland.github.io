&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, TMTDT started as a small collection of scripts that I used to augment ToDoist with features they can&amp;rsquo;t/won&amp;rsquo;t implement. It&amp;rsquo;s grown quite a bit since then.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those scripts started as simple idea and quickly morphed into a creaky, but essential, tool. As more features were added it continued too morph into an unmaintainable mess. Untangling that mess was on my todo list but never a high priority partly because of issues TMTDT was designed to solve 🤦.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
